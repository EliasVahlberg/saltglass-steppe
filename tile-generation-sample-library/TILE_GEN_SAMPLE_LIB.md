# Tile Generation Sample Library

This library demonstrates the capabilities of the tile generation system across different biomes, terrain types, and Points of Interest (POI).

## Generation Parameters

Each sample is generated using a JSON configuration file that specifies:
- **Seed**: Deterministic random seed for reproducible results
- **Dimensions**: Width and height of the generated tile map
- **Biome**: Environmental theme (saltflat, desert, ruins, scrubland, oasis)
- **Terrain**: Topographical features (flat, hills, canyon, mesa, dunes)
- **POI**: Point of Interest structures (town, shrine, landmark, dungeon, or null)
- **Output Layers**: Which generation phases to include in output
