- Sanity meter alongside HP
- Effects of low sanity (hallucinations, poor decisions)
- Ways to restore mental health
- Adaptation effects on sanity

## Data-Driven Implementation Notes

All these systems should be implemented with data-driven design principles:

1. **Configuration in JSON**: Behavior parameters, costs, durations should be in data files
2. **Modular Design**: Each system should be a separate module that can be enabled/disabled
3. **Event System**: Use events to decouple systems (e.g., "player_gained_adaptation" event)
4. **Save/Load Support**: All new systems must serialize properly
5. **Testing Support**: Each system should have DES test scenarios

## Implementation Order Recommendation

1. **Currency + Basic Trading** - Enables economic gameplay loop
2. **Equipment System** - Makes loot meaningful
3. **Faction Reputation** - Enables social consequences
4. **Advanced Item Properties** - Makes items feel unique
5. **Combat Behaviors** - Makes enemies interesting
6. **Dialogue System** - Enables rich NPC interactions
7. **Quest System** - Provides structured goals
8. **Ritual System** - Enables transformation mechanics

This order ensures each system builds on previous ones and provides immediate gameplay value.
