# Quest Spine --- *Saltglass Steppe*

_A campaign arc that ties White Noon → saint-keys → Heliograph truth → endgame choice, with faction-branching outcomes and repeatable roguelike-friendly structure._

---

## Structural Principles (So the Spine Works in a Roguelike)

- Modular Acts: Each act is a cluster of objectives that can be tackled in different orders; storms can reshuffle routes without breaking logic.
- Hard Gates = Soft Solutions: Saint-keys `⚷` are the "clean" gate into Archives. Alternative solutions exist (veil tincture, brute force, bargains), but with risk and faction consequences.
- Refraction as Story Currency: Hitting adaptation thresholds unlocks *new* dialogue, *new* faction offers, and *new* endgame options---while also increasing threat from Archive systems.
- Faction Alignment is reversible until Act III: Early actions create *lean* but not hard-lock. Midgame requires commitment.

---

## Cast Anchors (Recurring Quest-Givers)

- Brother Halix (Mirror Monks): prophecy interpreter; wants angles & proof.
- Forewoman Ressa Vane (Sand-Engineers): infrastructure leader; wants control & forecasts.
- Sable-of-the-Seam (Glassborn): route-speaker; wants kinship & transformation.
- Custodian IRI-7 (Archive): gatekeeper; wants protocol compliance.
- The Unnamed Pilgrim (dying): triggers the spine; points to the first key.

---

## ACT I --- *Salt Testament* (White Noon's Echo)

### Goal

Establish the core mystery: White Noon wasn't "just disaster." It was a commanded event---and the command structure still exists.

### Act I Key Locations

- The Vitrified Library Wedge (glass-fused stacks; Scripture Shards `?`)
- The West Corridor Rotations (a storm-edit "hotspot" that teaches map rewriting)
- A Hermit Brine-Shelter (safe rest node; Veil Tincture rumor)

### Core Quest Beats

#### 1) *The Pilgrim's Last Angle*

- Hook: The player finds a dying pilgrim with a Scripture Shard and a half-map to "a door that still remembers."
- Objective: Recover the Pilgrim's cache before the next storm edit overwrites the approach.
- Gameplay: Storm timer pressure + "post-storm diff" navigation (changed tiles marked).
- Reward: Scripture Shard `?` + rumor of a saint-key entombed in a "saint's eye."

Log tone examples

```
The pilgrim grips your sleeve---salt cracks at his lips.
He presses a shard into your palm. "A door... that still remembers."
Storm wind rises. The flats taste of copper.
```

#### 2) *Saint's Eye Reliquary*

- Objective: Locate a Saint's Tear `○` inside a fused chapel-node; it contains a partial credential imprint.
- Twist: Using the Tear can reduce Refraction (pulling you back toward baseline)---but the Monks call it heresy and the Glassborn call it self-erasure.
- Reward Choices:
  - Consume the Tear: safer around drones, slower adaptation path.
  - Preserve it: trade leverage + later unlock for Archive negotiation.

#### 3) *The First Key (Broken)*

- Objective: Retrieve a damaged saint-key `⚷` that fails full authentication.
- Gate Established: It opens *some* Archive doors, but flags you with "incomplete credentials."
- Consequences: Drones don't immediately kill you---but they will shadow and escalate.

Act I Outcome You learn a crucial thesis: Archive systems still recognize sainthood as a credential class, and White Noon references appear in Archive fragments as a _named operation_.

---

## ACT II --- *Keys of the Unfinished Saints* (Saint-Keys as Power)

### Goal

Assemble enough authority (keys, lens-logic, or brute capacity) to reach a deep Archive wing that contains the White Noon directive chain.

### Act II Key Locations

- The Crucible Block (glass-fused industrial district; Engineer salvage zone)
- The Choir of Shards (Monk storm-chapel; prophecy trials)
- Seam-Routes of the Glassborn (moving "safe" paths that change after storms)
- Archive Perimeter Rings (drone patrol patterns; credential checks)

### Spine Quest Cluster (Nonlinear)

#### A) *Keymaking vs Keyfinding*

You need two additional credential proofs to reach the deep wing; choose paths:

1.  Mirror Monk Path --- "Angle-Authority"

    - Quest: Recover three Scripture Shards whose angles "complete" a credential prayer.
    - Mechanic: Requires an Angle-Split Lens `◎` to reveal hidden text paths.
    - Reward: A "liturgical override" that can *temporarily* pass a drone check (not permanent access).

2.  Sand-Engineer Path --- "Hardware Authority"

    - Quest: Salvage optics and power couplers from Crucible Block to build a Storm Forecast Instrument (lets you preview storm edit types).
    - Reward: Forecast tool + a "spoof module" that makes the broken key behave like a valid one... sometimes.

3.  Glassborn Path --- "Kinship Authority"

    - Quest: Undertake a Crucible-adjacent rite (survive a high-intensity storm in a marked zone).
    - Reward: A stable adaptation (player-chosen) + access to Glassborn seam-routes that bypass some Archive chokepoints.

#### B) *The Second Key (Intact)*

- Objective: Acquire one intact saint-key `⚷`.
- Acquisition Methods (faction-colored):
  - Monks: "earned" through storm-walk interpretation.
  - Engineers: extracted from a sealed drone-hub via tools and forecasting.
  - Glassborn: traded for Storm Glass `◆` and proof of transformation.

Act II Outcome You now have enough standing to approach Custodian IRI-7 and request a deep query---but your _body_ increasingly becomes a problem: the more adapted you are, the more you are flagged as deviation.

---

## ACT III --- *The Custodian's Query* (Heliograph Truth)

### Goal

Gain entry to the Deep Archive Wing and reconstruct the White Noon directive chain: who ordered it, why, and what remains active now.

### Act III Key Locations

- Deep Wing: "OPERATION: WHITE NOON"
  - Rooms that rotate under storm influence (storms actively "protect" the truth).
  - Credential-locked terminals (saint-key checks).
  - Refraction hazards (glare tiles; beam corridors).
- Custodian IRI-7's Chamber
  - Dialogue node that changes based on your adaptations and key status.

### Major Revelations (Delivered as Query Outputs + Environmental Story)

1.  White Noon was an "Alignment Correction," not an attack.

    - The Heliograph detected a planet-scale deviation (ecological collapse, orbit drift, or systemic sabotage---kept slightly ambiguous for mythic tone).
    - Its correction parameters were catastrophically miscalibrated.

2.  The saints did not "rule" the Heliograph---they negotiated with it.

    - Saint-keys are not mere access cards; they are *roles* in a protocol---authority by identity.

3.  The Heliograph is still running an incomplete correction loop.

    - Glass storms are the system's continuing attempt to finish what White Noon started.
    - The "Patterning" is the loop tightening.

### Act III "Point of No Return"

IRI-7 offers you a sanctioned escalation:

- You can become a temporary authority (a living saint proxy) if you submit to a calibration scan.
- Mechanically: this can grant powerful control over certain light systems, but increases permanent social consequences (Monk reverence/expectation, Engineer exploitation, Drone scrutiny).

Act III Outcome You obtain the Heliograph Vector: a location/time window where the storm-edit cycle can be influenced---_once_.

---

## ACT IV --- *The Vector Choice* (Endgame Decision)

### Goal

Travel to the Vector site during a forecasted storm window and make a single irreversible intervention in the Heliograph loop.

### Endgame Arena (Shared Structure)

- The Vector Spire (a mirrored ruin that acts like a ground-side lens)
- Three approach routes (faction routes) that alter enemy mixes and hazards:
  - Monk approach: prophecy shrines + wraith density `◊`
  - Engineer approach: drone corridors `Δ` + mechanical traps
  - Glassborn approach: living-glass zones + intense refraction growth

### The Four Endgame Choices (Core)

Each choice is thematically coherent and mechanically grounded.

---

## Ending Choice 1 --- Seal the Heliograph ("Mercy Through Darkness")

Action: Use saint-key authority + Archive protocols to shut down the correction loop. Immediate effect: Storms cease; many glass-born phenomena begin to dissipate.

- Gameplay/World Result:
  - Fewer map rewrites (world stabilizes).
  - Refraction sources diminish; some adaptations become harder to acquire.
  - Archive Drones become *more* active in remaining powered zones (they interpret shutdown as intrusion).

### Faction Outcomes

- Mirror Monks: Schism.
  - Halix calls it blasphemy---"you silenced scripture."
  - A reformist monk sect quietly thanks you---"now we must learn to speak without storms."
- Sand-Engineers: Celebrate.
  - Infrastructure can be rebuilt; stable routes form; wells become reliable.
- Glassborn: Grief and rage in equal measure.
  - Some feel you committed cultural extinction; others feel relief from a life of forced becoming.

Quest epilogues:

- "The Quiet Steppe" rebuilding arc (Engineer-heavy).
- Monk schism hunts (prophet vs reformer).
- Glassborn diaspora conflicts.

---

## Ending Choice 2 --- Recalibrate the Heliograph ("Right the Angle")

Action: Alter storm parameters---storms become less lethal but more purposeful; maps still shift, but with readable patterns.

- Gameplay/World Result:
  - Storm forecast becomes highly reliable (more tactical play).
  - Glass terrain still exists; glare hazards become more structured and learnable.
  - New "calibrated storm" enemies appear (more predictable, more specialized).

### Faction Outcomes

- Mirror Monks: Canonization impulse.
  - They treat you as a living interpreter; reverence becomes political control attempts.
- Sand-Engineers: Uneasy alliance.
  - They gain predictability but fear dependence on a system they can't fully own.
- Glassborn: A new pride.
  - Recalibration is seen as legitimizing transformation as a stable lineage.

Quest epilogues:

- Build a "Calibration Charter" with Engineers (govern storm usage).
- Monk coronation attempt (accept or reject becoming a saint-figure).
- Glassborn seek to establish permanent seam-cities.

---

## Ending Choice 3 --- Claim Sainthood (Assume Authority) ("Wear the Key as Skin")

Action: Merge your identity with the saint-key protocol---becoming a living credential the system recognizes.

- Gameplay/World Result:
  - You can command certain Archive systems (doors, beams, drone stand-down) at a cost (Refraction drain, cooldowns, or permanent "marking").
  - Storms intensify around you periodically (the system "tracks" its authority node).

### Faction Outcomes

- Mirror Monks: Total reverence---total expectation.
  - You become the center of a new doctrine; refusal triggers holy conflict.
- Sand-Engineers: Conditional cooperation.
  - They will use you as access---until they fear you are a single point of failure.
- Glassborn: Split response.
  - Some see you as proof that becoming is ascension; others see you as surrender to the old machine.

Quest epilogues:

- Manage/escape an emerging theocracy.
- Engineer plotline to duplicate your credential imprint (with or without consent).
- Archive Custodian begins treating you as a peer---coldly.

---

## Ending Choice 4 --- Break the Vector (Let the Storm Finish) ("Become the Correction")

Action: Refuse control and instead amplify the loop---allowing the Steppe to complete its transformation cycle.

- Gameplay/World Result:
  - Storms become more frequent; the world grows stranger but rule-consistent.
  - Adaptations are easier to gain; social consequences become extreme.
  - New storm-born entities proliferate; some human settlements fail.

### Faction Outcomes

- Mirror Monks: Ecstatic confirmation.
  - "Scripture completes itself." They become dominant---until internal interpretations clash.
- Sand-Engineers: Collapse or exile.
  - Practical infrastructure can't keep up; they either adapt radically or leave.
- Glassborn: Triumph.
  - The world becomes a homeland tailored to their nature.

Quest epilogues:

- "Last Wells" Engineer survival chain (tragic but not grimdark---hope through ingenuity).
- Monk civil wars over interpretation.
- Glassborn founding of the First Seam-Court.

# Faction-Specific Branching (How the Same Spine Feels Different)

## Mirror Monk Campaign Flavor

- Primary verbs: interpret, undergo, consecrate, recover scripture.
- Key mechanic pressures: high refraction encouraged; social obligation increases with adaptations.
- Unique midgame unlock: "Angle-Rites" that reveal hidden routes during storms (temporary map truth).

## Sand-Engineer Campaign Flavor

- Primary verbs: salvage, build, forecast, stabilize.
- Key mechanic pressures: minimize uncontrolled mutation; use tools (veil, brine, tear) to manage refraction.
- Unique midgame unlock: advanced storm forecast (shows edit types + intensity), enabling tactical positioning and planning.

## Glassborn Campaign Flavor

- Primary verbs: become, trade kinship, navigate seams, survive intensity.
- Key mechanic pressures: embrace adaptation thresholds; gain access and discounts but increase Archive hostility.
- Unique midgame unlock: Seam-Route traversal---post-storm "shortcuts" that only appear to the heavily adapted (or through specific lenses).

# Spine-Compatible "Big Ticket" Quests (Optional, Highly Replayable)

1.  The Key Auction

    - A Glassborn Merchant offers a saint-key---price changes based on your adaptations.
    - Multiple ways to pay: Storm Glass `◆`, service, betrayal.

2.  Drone Amnesty

    - Engineers propose a plan to rewrite drone patrol protocols.
    - Monks call it tampering with scripture; Glassborn call it fear of the past.

3.  Halix's Trial

    - Halix demands you storm-walk to prove prophecy.
    - You can comply, refuse, or fake compliance using Veil Tincture `!`---each route has reputation fallout.

4.  IRI-7's Paradox

    - Custodian asks you to retrieve a node that proves the saints lied---or proves they were right.
    - Truth becomes a weapon factions will kill for.
