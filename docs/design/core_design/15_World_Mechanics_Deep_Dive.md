# World Mechanics Deep Dive

**Purpose:** To provide pseudo-scientific and systemic explanations for the "magical" elements of the Saltglass Steppe, grounding them in the game's internal logic.

## 1. The Physics of Refraction

**The Question:** How does light mutate biology?

**The Explanation:**
In the Saltglass Steppe, "Light" is not just photons. The Heliograph Network transmits data _encoded_ on high-frequency carrier waves within the visible spectrum. This is **Photonic Data Density**.

- **The Mechanism:** When this high-density light hits organic matter, it doesn't just heat it; it attempts to "write" data to the cells.
- **Biology as Storage:** Human DNA is treated by the Heliograph as a storage medium. "Adaptations" are essentially file corruption or successful software patches applied to biological hardware.
- **Crystalline Growth:** The body produces silicate structures (glass) to cope with the excess energy. This is an immune response. The glass acts as a heat sink and a data buffer.

**In-Game Logic:**

- **Refraction Stat:** Measures the percentage of your body that has been converted to silicate data-buffers.
- **High Refraction:** Allows you to "read" the data in the light (magic/tech usage) but makes you vulnerable to "overwriting" (taking extra damage from light/storms).

## 2. The Storm Algorithm

**The Question:** Why do storms rearrange the map?

**The Explanation:**
The Heliograph is running a **Terraforming Correction Loop**.

1.  **Scan:** It maps the current terrain.
2.  **Compare:** It compares it to a corrupted "Golden Age" blueprint file.
3.  **Edit:** It uses high-energy lasers to cut, melt, and move matter to match the blueprint.
4.  **Error:** The blueprint is fragmented. One day it tries to build a park; the next, a highway. The result is a collage of conflicting realities.

**In-Game Logic:**

- **Determinism:** The "randomness" of the storm is actually a seeded procedural generation algorithm. If you know the seed (Time + Location), you can predict the Edit.
- **Storm Compass:** A device that decrypts the local "Edit Packet" to show which tiles will change before they do.

## 3. The "Memory" of Glass

**The Question:** Why do people see ghosts in the glass?

**The Explanation:**
**Vitrified Data Remanence.**
When the White Noon hit, the intense energy flash-fused not just the buildings, but the _electromagnetic patterns_ of the people inside them.

- **Holographic Storage:** The glass of the Steppe is a 3D storage medium. It holds "snapshots" of the moments of vitrification.
- **Playback:** When light hits the glass at the correct angle (the "Read Angle"), the stored EM pattern is projected. This looks like a ghost, but it's a recording.
- **Interactive Echoes:** Some patterns were active AIs or neural uploads. These are "living" ghosts—software running on a substrate of city-sized glass.

**In-Game Logic:**

- **Lore Fragments:** "Reading" a wall isn't magic; it's finding the right angle to trigger the playback.
- **Psychic Enemies:** "Ghosts" are just aggressive EM patterns trying to overwrite the player's neural pathways.

## 4. The Economy of Scarcity vs. Belief

**The Question:** Why is glass valuable if it's everywhere?

**The Explanation:**
Not all glass is **Active**.

- **Inert Glass:** 99% of the desert. Just melted sand. Worthless.
- **Storm Glass (Active):** Glass formed during a storm event. It holds a charge. It vibrates. It is warm.
- **Value Source:**
  - **Engineers:** Value it as a battery/capacitor. (Utility Value).
  - **Monks:** Value it as a scripture fragment. (Religious Value).
  - **Glassborn:** Value it as a body part/prosthetic. (Biological Value).

**In-Game Logic:**

- **Currency (`salt_scrip`):** Backed by water reserves, but "Storm Glass" is the high-value trade good.
- **Dynamic Pricing:** A Monk merchant pays more for "Scripture Shards" (useless to Engineers). An Engineer pays more for "Capacitor Nodes" (useless to Monks).
