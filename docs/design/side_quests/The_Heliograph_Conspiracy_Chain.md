- The Architect is antagonist but not evil—her motivations are understandable
- Player must weigh individual freedom vs. species survival
- Consequences affect entire game world, not just player

### Investigation Mechanics
- Requires careful attention to environmental storytelling
- Rewards players who read documents and connect clues
- Multiple sources of information create complete picture
- Some evidence can only be understood with technical knowledge

### Faction Integration
- Every major faction has stake in the outcome
- Player's existing relationships affect available options
- Choices create new faction dynamics and alliances
- No faction is entirely right or wrong about the situation

### Technical Requirements
- Dynamic storm system that changes based on quest outcomes
- Faction reputation system that handles major paradigm shifts
- World state tracking for long-term consequences
- Multiple ending variations with different mechanical effects
