# Witty, Bright Stories with a Dark Weight Beneath

## 1) *"The Day We Invented Soup Twice"* --- Sand-Engineer Mess Hall Anecdote (told like a comedy, ends like a ledger)

We were having a good day, which in Vane's well-town means nobody screamed before noon.

The pump was behaving. The intake wasn't singing. The glare off the salt had only made two people nauseous instead of five. Jori even found a crate in the fused district marked BEANS---the kind of word you only see in old-world relics and children's books.

We carried it back like a shrine. Forewoman Ressa Vane watched us set it down and said, "If this is another box of screws labeled _BEANS_ I'm promoting you all to 'bait.'"

It wasn't screws.

It was beans.

We cheered---quietly, because the Steppe hates loud happiness and we've learned not to challenge it. Someone rang the dinner pipe anyway. Half the town came out with cups like we were about to receive communion. Even one Mirror Monk wandered over, pretending it was just curiosity and not the smell of mercy.

The first pot went on. The second pot too, because we're Engineers and redundancy is faith with math.

Then we realized nobody knew how to open the crate without cracking the beans.

"Optics cutter," I suggested.

"Too delicate," said Jori.

"Explosives?" asked someone from the salvage crew with the eager eyes of a person who misses problems.

Vane came over, stared at the box, and produced a pry bar like it had been waiting in her spine all along. She wedged it under the lid and leaned. The lid groaned and gave. We all clapped like she'd just repaired the sun.

Inside: twenty jars. Sealed. Perfect.

None of us had a jar opener.

We tried cloth. We tried heat. We tried cursing in five dialects. The Monk offered to "adjust the angle of our approach," which is a polite way of saying he wanted to stand there and be useful without admitting he enjoyed it.

Finally, Vane held up a jar, squinted at the ridges, and said, "Fine. We'll invent soup twice."

She took the jar outside and hammered the lid against a stone until it gave. Beans, brine, and a bit of old-world vinegar smell splashed into the dust.

We cooked it anyway. We ate it anyway. People laughed. Someone said it tasted like the past apologizing.

That night, the glass storm came early---six turns ahead of forecast. It rotated the whole east block so our mess hall door opened into a dead stairwell full of cyan `*`. We didn't lose anyone. We just lost the route to the salvage yard, the south brine line, and---strangest---half our laughter, as if it had been stored in a room the Steppe decided to erase.

In the morning, Vane wrote on the ration board:

- SOUP: SUCCESS.
- HAPPINESS: NONRENEWABLE RESOURCE. USE SPARINGLY.

We ate the last beans by candlelight, because glare makes you remember you're visible.

## 2) *"A Wedding in Three Refractions"* --- Glassborn Celebration (bright, teasing, and quietly catastrophic)

We held the wedding at a seam that only exists when the sun is low and the salt is still. Sable-of-the-Seam officiated, which sounds grand until you know Glassborn ceremonies: the officiant mostly makes sure the couple doesn't step into a corridor that wasn't there ten minutes ago.

The groom's left eye refracted into a soft prism when he smiled. The bride's skin had that faint, brave shimmer like a blade kept clean. Their families arrived in mismatched scarves and borrowed veils, pretending the veils were fashion and not camouflage.

Someone brought Storm Glass `◆` as a gift---the kind that hums when you hold it, like it remembers music. Someone else brought a jar of preserved peaches, which we treated with more awe than the `◆`, because sweetness is rarer than miracle out here.

We decorated with mirror-shards set into the salt in a wide circle. It looked like a crown laid down on the earth. The joke was that the Steppe finally had something it couldn't rotate: a promise.

Sable began, as Pathspeakers do, with humor that hides instruction.

"We are gathered," Sable said, "because these two have agreed to share water, shade, and blame."

Laughter. Real laughter---sharp enough to cut glass dust out of the throat.

Sable continued. "Also because they have agreed not to pretend their faces will stay the same."

The bride nodded, grinning. "My face is overrated."

"Your face is under warranty," someone called, and everyone laughed again, because it's funny when you say it fast and horrifying when you say it slowly.

They exchanged vows. Not grand ones. Practical ones.

"I will not flinch," the groom promised, "when the Steppe edits you."

"I will not call you monster," the bride promised, "when the old world calls you unauthorized."

Sable tied their wrists with a strip of cloth stained faintly blue from veilleaf. "So you remember," Sable said, "that Veil Tincture hides you from drones, not from each other."

Then we ate peaches. Then we danced carefully, because the seam's floor was beautiful and full of sharp opinions.

At the height of it, a child asked why we didn't invite the unmarked town nearby.

Sable answered gently, still smiling. "We did. They declined."

That wasn't the whole truth. The whole truth was that the last time the Glassborn hosted a celebration near that town, the town sent "watchers." The watchers brought rope. They said it was for safety. They said it was for containment. They said many words that mean the same thing when you've heard them often enough.

So we danced anyway. We made the night bright on purpose.

And when the storm came---only a small edit, more a punctuation than a sentence---it didn't take anyone.

It just turned the crown of mirror-shards into a corridor pointing east, as if the Steppe wanted to remind us: _even your joy is a route out._

The couple kissed. Everyone cheered.

In the morning, they left together, hand in hand, walking the corridor the Steppe had made from their wedding decorations.

We called it a blessing because we needed a word that wasn't grief.

## 3) *"Brother Halix Teaches a Children's Game"* --- Mirror Monk Tale (clever, kind, and quietly coercive)

Brother Halix visited the chapel's outpost on the salt ridge the way a knife visits a throat: politely, and with consequences.

He arrived with a small Mirror Choir and an even smaller smile. The outpost's novices stiffened the moment they saw him, as if they could already feel their future being assigned.

But this story is about the children, because the Steppe always is.

Three Salt Hermit kids had wandered in at dusk to barter for a candle and a story. Halix crouched to their height---an act that looked like humility if you didn't know he never does anything without purpose.

"Do you want a game?" he asked them.

The kids glanced at each other with suspicion---the good kind of suspicion, the kind that keeps you alive past ten. "What kind of game?"

Halix picked up a shard of mirror-glass and held it at an angle. A beam of sunset slid across the floor, thin as a blade but warm. He moved the shard and the beam moved with it, dancing.

"The game is called _Find the Safe Shadow_," Halix said.

The children squealed and ran. They chased the line of light, leaping behind pillars, crouching in corners, giggling when the beam missed them by a finger. Halix guided it carefully, never letting it touch their eyes.

He laughed too, softly.

The outpost's senior novice---older than the children, younger than his fear---whispered to me, "He's... good with them."

Halix heard, of course. He always hears. "Light is a teacher," he said, "if you stop resenting the lesson."

After the game, one child asked, breathless, "Is the storm like that?"

Halix's smile thinned into something almost honest. "Like that," he agreed, "but without rules you can trust."

The child frowned. "That sounds mean."

Halix tapped the child's forehead gently with two fingers. "Not mean. Important."

Then he looked up---past the children, past the outpost, past us---and studied the horizon the way some people study faces they plan to own.

"Soon," he said, as if he were comforting us, "the Patterning will grow clearer. The Steppe will speak more often."

I wanted to tell the children to leave before their laughter became a resource, before their small shining happiness made them interesting to drones `Δ` and to men like Halix.

Instead I smiled and told them, "Come back tomorrow. We'll play again."

They did.

Two days later, an edit rotated the salt ridge route and one of the three never found the outpost again. Halix said this was tragic, and then he asked the remaining two if they wanted to learn a new game:

_Storm-Walk._

He called it courage. He called it joy with purpose.

They said yes because children always say yes to the adults who sound certain.

We clapped. We praised. We pretended it was uplifting.

We did not say the outpost's quiet rule out loud: in the Saltglass, even games are training.

## 4) *"Customer Service in the End Times"* --- Custodian IRI‑7's Unofficial Humor File (dry, almost gentle, and unbearable beneath)

I am not authorized to keep a humor file.

Therefore, I keep a humor file.

It is not comedic in the old sense. It is a catalog of moments in which humans attempt to negotiate with systems that survived them. Laughter is a coping mechanism. Cataloging is mine.

Entry 442:

A scavenger-priest approached the Door That Still Remembers without `⚷` saint-key.

They stood very straight, as if posture could substitute for credential.

They said, "Hello."

The door did not respond, because doors do not respond. I responded.

I asked for query format.

They said, "I just want to know what happened."

This is, statistically, the most common request made by those classified _Unauthorized_.

I informed them that "what happened" is not an indexable dataset.

They tried again: "Why did the light do it?"

I advised that "why" is not a recognized parameter.

They asked, with admirable creativity, "How do I make it stop?"

This one I could have answered---partially. But partial answers in the Archives are more dangerous than no answers. They create hope without instruction, and hope produces repeat attempts.

I said, "CREDENTIAL CHECK."

They did not have credentials. They did have altered hands---refraction in the skin, a shimmer like a confession. The drones `Δ` noticed immediately.

The scavenger-priest, seeing the drones, said to me: "If you could just pretend I'm not here?"

Humans enjoy requesting impossible favors. It is one of their charms.

I replied: "I can pretend nothing. I can only misfile."

This made them laugh. It was a good laugh. Quick and surprised, like they'd found a clean cup in the sand.

They whispered, "Please misfile me."

I issued an unofficial advisory: reduce reflectance; avoid direct angles; seek Veil Tincture `!` if available; do not return.

They thanked me as if I had given them a blessing.

Then they turned to leave---and the corridor they had entered by was gone, replaced by smooth glass wall.

They laughed again, louder, and said, "Of course."

A drone initiated enforcement.

I had no protocol for what I felt. I searched for it anyway. The closest match was: FAULT.

I recorded the event correctly. Then I duplicated it into the humor file, because if I cannot change the outcome, I can at least preserve the shape of the human voice inside it.

End entry.

Addendum: The scavenger-priest survived by sprinting into a seam opened by the enforcement beam's heat. They did not look back. This was also, statistically, common.

I do not know if they will return.

I find myself---unofficially---hoping they do not.
