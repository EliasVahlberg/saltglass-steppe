# The Technical Codex: Pre-Event and Post-Event Technology

*Compiled by the Sand-Engineer Technical Council*  
*"Understanding the tools that shape our world"*

## Preface: Technology in Transition

The transformation changed more than just humanity—it fundamentally altered how technology functions. Pre-Event devices operate on principles that no longer apply consistently, while new technologies emerge from the intersection of quantum consciousness and engineered systems. This codex documents both categories, providing operational guidelines for survival and advancement.

**Technology Classification System:**
- **Legacy (L)**: Pre-Event technology, requires special maintenance
- **Hybrid (H)**: Pre-Event technology modified for post-Event conditions
- **Native (N)**: Technology developed after the transformation
- **Archive (A)**: Autonomous systems from the old world
- **Quantum (Q)**: Technology that interfaces with consciousness
