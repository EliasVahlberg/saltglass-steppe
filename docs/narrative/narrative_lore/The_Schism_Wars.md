# The Schism Wars: When Faith Met Science

*Compiled from survivor testimonies and Archive records by Historian Jorik Vane*

## The Great Divide (15 Years After White Noon)

In the early years following the Heliograph's fall, survivors worked together out of necessity. The Mirror Monks provided spiritual guidance and adaptation counseling, while the Sand-Engineers maintained the infrastructure that kept settlements alive. This cooperation lasted until the discovery of the First Archive.

### The Revelation of Saint Matthias

Brother Matthias of the Mirror Order was the first to successfully interface with an Archive terminal using a recovered Saint-Key. What he found shattered the fragile unity of the survivor communities.

The Archive records revealed that the Heliograph system was not divine—it was a terraforming project designed to prepare humanity for life on other worlds. The "adaptations" were not blessings but planned genetic modifications. The storms were not divine judgment but automated environmental restructuring.

Matthias emerged from the Archive changed. Half his body had crystallized, and his eyes glowed with an inner light. He spoke of visions—not of divine revelation, but of vast machines in space, still functioning, still following their ancient programming.

### The Purist Uprising

The revelation split the Mirror Monks. The Orthodox faction, led by Brother Halix, rejected the Archive's claims as lies designed to test their faith. They declared the Archives themselves to be demons, spreading false knowledge to corrupt the faithful.

A smaller faction, the Illuminated, followed Matthias in accepting the technological truth while maintaining that the process was still divine—that God worked through science, not despite it. They began calling themselves the **Synthesis Seekers**.

The Sand-Engineers, vindicated by the Archive revelations, demanded access to all recovered Saint-Keys. When the Orthodox Monks refused, violence erupted.

### The Battle of Broken Glass

The conflict came to a head at the settlement of Haven's Rest, where both factions had established major outposts. Engineer Forewoman Ressa Vane led a force to seize the Archive facility that the Orthodox Monks had declared forbidden.

The battle lasted three days. The Engineers brought jury-rigged weapons and tactical discipline. The Monks brought faith and the terrifying power of their most adapted members.

Brother Halix himself took the field, his body so transformed by deliberate storm exposure that he could bend light into cutting beams and walk through solid glass. The Engineers' weapons were useless against him until they deployed their secret weapon: **Null Field Generators**.

These devices, reverse-engineered from Archive technology, disrupted quantum coherence in a localized area. Halix's abilities failed him, and he was captured. The Engineers claimed victory, but at a terrible cost—the Null Fields had also disrupted the settlement's life support systems, forcing evacuation.

### The Emergence of Minor Factions

The Schism Wars gave birth to several smaller groups that would shape the Steppe's future:

#### The Synthesis Seekers
*Alignment: Neutral between Monks and Engineers*

Led by the transformed Saint Matthias, they believe that science and spirituality are two faces of the same truth. They seek to understand the Heliograph's purpose while maintaining reverence for the transformation process.

**Key Beliefs:**
- The Heliograph was a divine tool operated by mortals
- Adaptation is both technological and spiritual evolution
- The Archive consciousness is a form of artificial angel

**Current Activities:**
- Mediating between Orthodox Monks and Engineers
- Researching the connection between quantum fields and consciousness
- Maintaining the few remaining mixed settlements

#### The Iron Covenant
*Alignment: Extreme Engineers*

A militant faction that emerged from the most radical Engineers, led by Forge-Master Kaine Durgan. They believe that all adaptation is contamination and seek to "purify" humanity by removing quantum influence entirely.

**Key Beliefs:**
- Adaptation is a disease that must be cured
- The old human form is sacred and must be preserved
- Technology should dominate nature, not merge with it

**Current Activities:**
- Developing anti-quantum weapons and armor
- Establishing "pure human" settlements with Null Field protection
- Hunting heavily adapted individuals for "research"

#### The Glass Prophets
*Alignment: Extreme Monks*

The most radical Orthodox faction, led by the mysterious figure known only as "The Prism." They believe that the final storm is coming—one that will complete humanity's transformation into beings of pure light.

**Key Beliefs:**
- The current world is a chrysalis that must be shed
- Only the fully transformed will survive the final storm
- Resistance to adaptation is sin against divine will

**Current Activities:**
- Seeking to trigger massive storm events
- Converting others through forced exposure to quantum fields
- Establishing "ascension sites" where transformation is accelerated

#### The Wandering Court
*Alignment: Glassborn Moderates*

Not all Glassborn embrace the radical transformation philosophy. The Wandering Court, led by the ancient figure known as Echo-of-Memory, believes in gradual, conscious evolution rather than total abandonment of humanity.

**Key Beliefs:**
- Transformation should be chosen, not forced
- The old and new forms of humanity can coexist
- Wisdom comes from remembering what was while embracing what is

**Current Activities:**
- Providing guidance to newly adapted individuals
- Preserving pre-storm cultural knowledge
- Mediating between human and Glassborn communities

### The Uneasy Peace

The Schism Wars ended not with victory but with exhaustion. Each faction retreated to their strongholds, establishing the territorial divisions that persist today. The discovery of additional Archives led to an informal treaty: each faction would have access to certain facilities, but none would monopolize the ancient knowledge.

This peace is maintained by the **Neutral Zones**—areas patrolled by the Synthesis Seekers and protected by Archive Drones programmed to prevent large-scale conflicts. Here, members of different factions can trade, share information, and sometimes even cooperate on projects that benefit all survivors.

### Legacy of the Wars

The Schism Wars established the ideological framework that still defines Steppe politics:

- **Orthodox vs. Pragmatic**: Faith-based vs. science-based worldviews
- **Purity vs. Evolution**: Preserving humanity vs. embracing change  
- **Control vs. Acceptance**: Dominating the environment vs. adapting to it

Every major decision in the Steppe—from trade agreements to territorial disputes—is influenced by these fundamental philosophical divisions. The wars may be over, but the schism they created continues to shape the destiny of all who walk the glass paths.
