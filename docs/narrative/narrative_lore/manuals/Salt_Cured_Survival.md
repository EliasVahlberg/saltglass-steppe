# Salt-Cured Survival

_A collection of recipes and survival tips from the Salt Hermit enclaves._

## The Diet of the Steppe

Food does not grow in the Steppe; it endures. If you want to eat, you must learn to process toxins, extract moisture, and preserve everything.

### 1. Brine-Crust Bread

- **Ingredients:** Ground drought-root, salt-crystals, recycled water, yeast-culture (kept in a jar around your neck).
- **Preparation:** Mix into a dense dough. Bury in hot sand for 4 hours.
- **Result:** Hard as a rock. Must be soaked in water or broth to eat. Keeps for years.
- **Taste:** Salty, earthy, slightly metallic.

### 2. Glass-Beetle Stew

- **Catching:** Set a mirror-trap. Beetles are attracted to their own reflection. Smash them with a rock.
- **Cleaning:** **CRITICAL.** You must remove the "Spark-Gland" at the base of the neck. If you cook it, the beetle explodes.
- **Cooking:** Boil in brine for 2 hours to soften the shell. The meat is gelatinous.
- **Benefits:** High protein. Mild bioluminescence (your sweat will glow for a day).

### 3. Cactus-Needle Tea

- **Harvesting:** Use tongs. The needles are barbed.
- **Brewing:** Steep in boiling water.
- **Effect:** Mild stimulant. Suppresses appetite. Reduces radiation sickness symptoms.

## Water Discipline

- **The Stillsuit Myth:** We don't have fancy suits. We have "Vapor-Tents." Dig a hole, place a cup in the center, cover with a plastic sheet, put a stone in the middle. Condensation drips into the cup.
- **Blood-Water:** In an emergency, the blood of a Mirage Hound is drinkable _if_ you filter it through charcoal. Otherwise, the hallucinations will kill you.

## Shelter

- **Salt-Crete:** Mix salt, sand, and spit (or urine). It hardens into a concrete-like substance in the sun. Use it to seal cracks in your cave.
- **Glass-Insulation:** Pack layers of crushed glass between your tent walls. It reflects the heat during the day and traps it at night.

## The Hermit's Motto

"Eat the salt, or the salt eats you."
