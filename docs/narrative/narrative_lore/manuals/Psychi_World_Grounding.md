### Reasoning

- Creative Goals: The world of Saltglass Steppe fundamentally revolves around altered perception, reality, and the interplay of light, memory, and interpretation. Psychic abilities should deepen these themes rather than simply offering "magic" or power for its own sake. They need to feel like logical extensions of the environment and history, providing narrative purpose, emotional resonance, and mechanical depth.
- World Integration: Any introduction of psychic abilities must feel like a natural evolution from environmental and biological adaptation. "Refraction"---the world's central motif---suggests that consciousness, memory, and identity may be as mutable and fragmented as the landscape itself. Psychic powers should emerge from, react to, and further complicate the world's storm-borne transformations and social stratification.
- Faction and Social Impact: These abilities should alter not just personal power but how characters are perceived: as prophets, threats, or abominations. Monks may see them as heightened scripture-interpretation, Engineers as rogue side-effects, Glassborn as kinship-confirming, and Archives as errors to be isolated or studied.
- Gameplay & Emotional Engagement: Psychic talents should grant new ways to navigate dangers (literal and social), access or interpret hidden knowledge, and reshape outcomes---not just offer combat utility. They should create moments of wonder, dread, and moral ambiguity, forcing both player and character to grapple with their own "adaptation" and the price of insight.
- Genre Conventions: In narrative-driven RPGs, psychic phenomena often connect to themes of fate, memory, or trauma---here, they must be reimagined through the Steppe's lens: perception as hazardous, information as fugitive, mind and world as co-authors of reality.
- Potential Challenges: Avoiding clichés of "chosen one" or psionics as mere spellcasting; ensuring psychic powers don't undermine the world's established friction or tension; balancing narrative mystery with clear mechanics.

### Creative Direction/Recommendations

#### World Justification for Psychic Abilities

- Psycho-Refraction: Psychic abilities are not innate talents, but the cumulative byproduct of exposure to storms and adaptations (Shard-implantation, Crucible rites, etc.). Just as the storms fracture and rewrite the land, so too can they fracture and "recode" the senses, memory, and consciousness. Some who survive heavy exposure find that their thoughts briefly "prism"---split, mirrored, or focused beyond usual human limits. This transition is often as feared as any physical change.
  - Example: After surviving multiple glass storms, [character name] finds themselves able to "catch" echoes of past events imprinted in fused corridors---a phenomenon known locally as prism-memoria. In game terms, this triggers optional "memory visions" that reveal past uses or secrets of a location but at the risk of confusing personal memory or attracting storm anomalies.

#### Factional Perspectives and Uses

- Mirror Monks: Teach psycho-refraction as a higher sacrament ("the Angle Within")---the ability to interpret not just visible scripture in glass, but the invisible narratives embedded in places, relics, and people. Initiates master techniques for controlled focus---turning their minds into "lenses" that can read echoes, foresee potential storm paths, or intuit hostile intent based on light-shifting cues.
  - Example: Monk NPCs may lead the player through rites where their psychic focus alters the perception of a labyrinth, letting them "choose" between different architectural possibilities left by a recent storm-storm (mechanical application: route selection, uncovering hidden resources, or bypassing an ambush).
- Engineers: Dismiss psychic phenomena as storm-induced neurological errors ("Mirror Sickness" or "Refraction Epilepsy"). However, a few secretly study the potential for harnessing these episodes as predictive analytics---believing that certain mind-states can interface with legacy Archive tech by synchronizing with residual data patterns.
  - Example: Engineer quests may hinge on players using psychic "data sensing" to extract lost codes, map shifting corridors, or trigger ancient safety protocols when physical access would take too long---while risking neural degradation or temporary memory loss.
- Glassborn: Celebrate psycho-refraction as proof of full passage through the Steppe's crucible. Among them, psychic kinship is tested through mutual "shared resonance" rituals---group trance states where memories and perceptions blur, creating temporary unity or transmitting secret knowledge.
  - Example: In a key negotiation, Glassborn might demand the player submit to a psychic "melding" to prove kinship---introducing a narrative minigame where the player recalls or alters past choices in a collective memory-dream.

#### Mechanical Integration & Emotional Impact

- Core Game Systems: Psychic abilities serve as non-combat tools for navigation (seeing safe/hidden paths during storms), puzzle-solving (interpreting distorted or mirrored riddles), social manipulation (reading or projecting intentions in tense dialogues), and lore discovery (reliving steppe history or uncovering contemporaneous events).
- Psychic Stress / Overload: Using psychic talents too frequently or outside sanctioned rites risks "glass-mind"---symptoms include double vision, time-skips, or false memories. This mechanic balances power with cost and reinforces themes of instability, danger, and the world's resistance to being truly known.
- Narrative Payoff: Higher levels of adaptation---and thus psychic ability---open unique story paths, but may close off conventional ones (some groups see you as a prophet, others as a pariah). Absolute mastery invites endgame choices: attempt to rewrite a fragment of the Steppe's reality (becoming an "author" like the storms), or restore a memory so painful it may change the protagonist's final allegiance.

#### Hypothetical Character Example

- [Eirin Prism], Glassborn Seer: Once a scavenger-priest, Eirin survived three direct exposures and emerged able to "hear" the intersections of past and present in the Steppe's most complex labyrinths. She acts as a guide for those willing to risk psychic melds, but warns: "The city is not the only thing the storms rewrite." Eirin's gift allows parties to bypass hazards---but sometimes she leads them off course, chasing phantom memories or rewriting her own.

Summary of Key Recommendations:

- Ground psychic abilities in storm-caused psycho-refraction: the mind adapting to (and sometimes fracturing under) the mutability of the Steppe.
- Distinct factional attitudes---from the Monks' spiritual veneration, to the Engineers' skepticism, to the Glassborn's communal embrace---each provide unique narrative arcs and gameplay unlocks.
- Use psychic powers primarily for narrative and environmental mastery, not simple combat utility.
- Mechanically bind psychic use to risks: psychic stress, memory distortion, and changing social status.
- Tie highest-level psychic talents to moral/emotional reckoning and critical, reality-altering choices at the game's climax.

This approach preserves the integrity and uniqueness of Saltglass Steppe, deepens its core mysteries, and leverages psychic phenomena to enhance both story and meaningful player agency.
