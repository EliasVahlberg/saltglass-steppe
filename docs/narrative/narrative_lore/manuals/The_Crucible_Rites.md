# The Crucible Rites

_Transcribed from the oral traditions of the Glassborn by an anonymous scribe._

## The Philosophy of the Break

To the Glassborn, the human body is not a vessel; it is a rough draft. The "Crucible" is the process of editing that draft to match the new reality of the Steppe. It is not about abandoning humanity, but about surviving it.

## The Three Stages

### 1. The Fracture (Preparation)

The initiate must spend three days in a "Silence Chamber"—a room lined with sound-dampening lead and dark glass. They are given only brine-water.

- **Purpose:** To break the reliance on the old senses. To force the mind to listen to the internal hum of the body's own bio-electricity.
- **The Test:** The initiate must locate a single grain of Storm Glass hidden in the room using only the sensation of "static" on their skin.

### 2. The Fusion (Exposure)

The initiate is taken to a "Lens-Bed"—a natural formation where sunlight is focused by the landscape into a high-intensity zone. They are strapped down.

- **The Catalyst:** A "Prism-Doctor" places specific shards of active Storm Glass into incisions made along the meridian lines of the body (spine, arms, optic nerves).
- **The Event:** At high noon, the mirrors are aligned. The light hits the shards. The heat is intense enough to cauterize the wounds instantly and fuse the glass to the bone.
- **Survival:** 30% of initiates go into shock. 10% suffer "Burnout" (total vitrification). The rest begin the change.

### 3. The Polish (Integration)

The survivor is submerged in a nutrient-rich gel tank salvaged from Archive medical bays. They sleep for a week while the body rejects or accepts the glass.

- **Result:** If successful, the glass becomes part of the nervous system. The initiate wakes up able to "see" light currents and "feel" the approach of a storm.

## Types of Ascendance

- **Luminaries:** Glass fused to eyes/brain. They act as scouts and navigators.
- **Resonators:** Glass fused to vocal cords/lungs. They can generate sonic frequencies to shatter obstacles or communicate over long distances.
- **Wardens:** Glass fused to skin/muscle. They are the armored protectors, capable of deflecting laser fire.

## The Oath of the Prism

"I am the lens, not the light.
I am the shape, not the reflection.
I break to be built.
I shatter to be sharp."
