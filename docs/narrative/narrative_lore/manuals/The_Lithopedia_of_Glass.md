# The Lithopedia of Glass

*A field guide to the silicate variations of the Steppe, compiled by the Synthesis Seekers.*

## Introduction
Glass is not uniform. The specific frequency of the Heliograph beam at the moment of vitrification determines the molecular structure and "magical" properties of the resulting glass.

## Primary Classifications

### 1. Fulgurite (Storm-Glass)
*   **Appearance:** Jagged, branching tubes. Glowing with internal static. Usually pale yellow or electric blue.
*   **Origin:** Formed when a Storm-Beam strikes sand directly.
*   **Properties:**
    *   **Capacitive:** Stores immense electrical charge.
    *   **Volatile:** Explodes if cracked.
*   **Uses:** Batteries, explosives, shock-batons.

### 2. Obsidian (Null-Glass)
*   **Appearance:** Opaque, matte black. Absorbs all light. Cold to the touch.
*   **Origin:** Formed in "Shadow Zones" where the beam was blocked but the heat was still intense (convection vitrification).
*   **Properties:**
    *   **Insulative:** Blocks all data transmission and light.
    *   **Stealth:** Does not reflect radar or sonar.
*   **Uses:** Armor, stealth cloaks, containment boxes for dangerous artifacts.

### 3. Prism-Shard (Active-Glass)
*   **Appearance:** Perfectly clear, geometric shapes. Splits white light into rainbows.
*   **Origin:** Pre-Collapse high-tech glass (fiber optics, screens) fused with atmospheric particles.
*   **Properties:**
    *   **Refractive:** Can bend and focus light beams.
    *   **Computational:** Can process simple logic gates if light is pulsed through it.
*   **Uses:** Lenses, logic cores, laser weaponry.

### 4. Verdant-Glass (Bio-Glass)
*   **Appearance:** Emerald green, swirled with brown. Looks like frozen moss.
*   **Origin:** Forests or farmland that were vitrified. The carbon from the plants is trapped in the silica matrix.
*   **Properties:**
    *   **Regenerative:** Slowly repairs itself if chipped.
    *   **Resonant:** Vibrates when exposed to "Growth" frequencies.
*   **Uses:** Medical tools, self-repairing structures, hydroponic vats.

### 5. Sanguine-Glass (Blood-Glass)
*   **Appearance:** Deep crimson. Warm. Pulses faintly.
*   **Origin:** *[REDACTED]* (Believed to be mass-grave sites or hospitals).
*   **Properties:**
    *   **Bonding:** Fuses easily with human flesh.
    *   **Memory:** Often contains high-fidelity "Echoes" (Ghosts).
*   **Uses:** Prosthetics (Glassborn), forbidden rituals.

## Rare Variations

*   **Aero-Glass:** Frothy, lightweight. Floats on water. Used for rafts.
*   **Mirror-Slate:** Flat, perfectly reflective sheets. Used by Monks for signaling.
