# Archive Interaction Protocols

_A survival guide for scavengers attempting to access Archive facilities._

## Threat Levels

The Archive Defense System (ADS) categorizes all organic life into four tiers. Knowing your tier can save your life.

### Tier 4: Fauna (Ignore)

- **Subjects:** Small animals, non-threatening wildlife.
- **Response:** Drones will ignore unless provoked or obstructing a patrol route.
- **Strategy:** Make yourself small. Don't carry tech.

### Tier 3: Unauthorized Civilian (Deter)

- **Subjects:** Unarmed humans, scavengers without credentials.
- **Response:** Warning shots, sonic deterrents, non-lethal capture.
- **Strategy:** Run. If you drop your weapon and tech, they might let you go.

### Tier 2: Hostile Combatant (Terminate)

- **Subjects:** Armed intruders, individuals damaging Archive property.
- **Response:** Lethal force. Laser fire, hunter-killer drones.
- **Strategy:** Fight or die. EMP grenades are your only friend.

### Tier 1: Anomalous Entity (Contain/Purge)

- **Subjects:** Heavily adapted individuals (Glassborn), high-refraction mutants.
- **Response:** Maximum aggression. The Archive views mutation as "data corruption."
- **Strategy:** You cannot hide. Your very biology triggers their sensors. Avoid Archive zones entirely.

## Credential Spoofing

If you possess a **Saint-Key** (`⚷`), you can attempt to spoof a Tier 0 (Authorized User) status.

1.  **Presentation:** Hold the key visible in your right hand. Do not make sudden movements.
2.  **Handshake:** The drone will scan the key. You will hear a high-pitched chime.
3.  **Query:** The drone may ask a challenge question in Old World binary or cipher.
    - _Correct Answer:_ Access granted. Drones become passive/defensive of you.
    - _Incorrect Answer:_ Immediate reclassification to Tier 2 (Hostile).
    - _Silence:_ Reclassification to Tier 3 (Civilian).

**WARNING:** Damaged keys can cause unpredictable results, ranging from drone self-destruction to summoning a heavy combat unit. Use at your own risk.
