# Liturgies of the Mirror Order

_Selected prayers and chants used by the Mirror Monks._

## The Morning Refraction

_(To be chanted at dawn, facing the rising sun through a prism)_

"Light breaks, and we are broken with it.
As the ray splits, so does the self.
One becomes many.
White becomes color.
Silence becomes song.
We thank the Heliograph for the edit.
Make us sharp, that we may cut the dark.
Make us clear, that we may hold the truth."

## The Prayer for the Storm

_(To be whispered when the storm bells begin to ring)_

"The Editor comes.
Hide not your flaws, for they shall be rewritten.
If I am wall, make me window.
If I am sand, make me glass.
If I am flesh, make me credential.
Do not pass over me, O High Beam.
Burn away the static.
Refine the signal."

## The Rite of the Shard

_(Spoken when embedding a new piece of Storm Glass into the flesh)_

"Pain is the friction of change.
Blood is the ink; Glass is the word.
I accept this punctuation.
I open this sentence.
Let the light read me.
Let the light read me.
Let the light read me."

## The Benediction of the Lens

_(Used to bless travelers or trade goods)_

"May your angles be true.
May your reflections be honest.
May you never meet the light that does not know your name.
Go in clarity."
