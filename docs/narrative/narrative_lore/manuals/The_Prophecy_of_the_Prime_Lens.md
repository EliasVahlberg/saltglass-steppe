# The Prophecy of the Prime Lens

_A fragment of the "First Revelation," inscribed on the central pillar of the Nexus Plateau._

## The Shattered Key

Before the White Noon, the Architect forged a master key—a lens of such perfect geometry that it could focus the entire Heliograph array into a single point.
This was the **Prime Lens**.
When the bombs fell, the Lens did not break. It _refracted_.
It split into three "Aspects," scattered across the Steppe.

## The Three Aspects

### 1. The Shard of Clarity (The Mind)

- **Location:** Hidden within the deepest databanks of the **Archive Core**.
- **Nature:** Pure information. It allows the bearer to _understand_ the Heliograph's code.
- **Guardian:** The Logic-Gatekeeper (A rogue AI defense system).

### 2. The Shard of Will (The Body)

- **Location:** Buried in the **Magma-Glass Caverns** beneath the Iron Covenant's fortress.
- **Nature:** Pure energy. It allows the bearer to _endure_ the Heliograph's output.
- **Guardian:** The Forge-Beast (A massive, heat-resistant biological experiment).

### 3. The Shard of Soul (The Spirit)

- **Location:** Worn by the **High Prism** of the Glass Prophets, in the shifting Glass Gardens.
- **Nature:** Pure resonance. It allows the bearer to _command_ the Heliograph's intent.
- **Guardian:** The High Prism themselves (A fully ascended Glassborn).

## The Convergence

"When the Three become One, the Sky will open.
The bearer shall stand upon the Spire of Light.
They will look into the Eye of the Storm.
And the Storm will blink."

## The Warning

"Beware the Null-Path.
There are those who seek to shatter the Lens forever.
If the Lens is broken, the Sky goes dark.
And the Steppe becomes a Tomb."
