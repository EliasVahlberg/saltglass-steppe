# Scavenger's Guide to Storm Glass

_A handwritten pamphlet circulated among the trade caravans of the Saltglass Steppe. The author is anonymous, known only as "Dusty"._

## Introduction

So, you want to get rich? You want to pick up the shiny rocks the storms leave behind? Listen close, greenhorn, or you'll end up as a statue in someone else's garden.

Storm Glass isn't just pretty. It's frozen energy. It's unstable, it's sharp, and it remembers the heat that made it.

## Types of Glass

### 1. Common Shard (The "Chump Change")

- **Appearance:** Dull, cloudy, jagged edges.
- **Value:** Low. Used for basic tools and cheap jewelry.
- **Danger:** Low. Just don't cut yourself.
- **Handling:** Leather gloves are fine.

### 2. Singing Glass (The "Hummer")

- **Appearance:** Clear, vibrates slightly when touched.
- **Value:** Medium. Engineers buy this for acoustic sensors.
- **Danger:** Medium. Prolonged contact can cause numbness or temporary deafness.
- **Handling:** Wrap in heavy cloth. Don't put it near your ears.

### 3. Prism-Core (The "Payday")

- **Appearance:** Perfect geometric shape, splits light into rainbows.
- **Value:** High. Monks and Engineers will bid war over these.
- **Danger:** High. Can focus ambient light into a laser beam if you're not careful.
- **Handling:** Lead-lined box. Keep it in the dark. NEVER look directly through it at the sun.

### 4. Void-Glass (The "Widowmaker")

- **Appearance:** Black, absorbs light. Looks like a hole in the world.
- **Value:** Astronomical. The Archive Drones will kill you for it.
- **Danger:** Extreme. Touching it with bare skin causes instant necrosis. It eats heat.
- **Handling:** Tongs. Vacuum-sealed container. Better yet, leave it alone.

## Harvesting Tips

1.  **Wait for the Cool-Down:** Fresh glass is hot. Not just temperature-hot, but radiation-hot. Give a storm site at least 24 hours before you go picking.
2.  **Watch the Reflections:** If you see a reflection that doesn't match the object casting it, RUN. That's a spatial anomaly, and it will turn you inside out.
3.  **Listen to the Ground:** If the glass starts crunching rhythmically under your boots, you're walking on a Shard Spider nest. Step lightly.
4.  **Don't Get Greedy:** The heavier your pack, the slower you run. And out here, speed is life.

## Selling Your Haul

- **Engineers:** Pay by weight and purity. Honest, but stingy.
- **Monks:** Pay based on "spiritual resonance." Can be a fortune or a pittance. Don't try to haggle; they think it's vulgar.
- **Glassborn:** Will trade rare adaptations or safe passage. Good if you want to survive, bad if you want to eat.

Stay sharp, stay covered, and remember: If it glows, it probably hates you.
