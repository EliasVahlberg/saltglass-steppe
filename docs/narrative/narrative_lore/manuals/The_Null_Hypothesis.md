# The Null Hypothesis

*A forbidden text circulated among the Iron Covenant, attributed to a rogue Archive AI.*

## The Nature of Darkness

We assume darkness is the absence of light.
In the Steppe, this is false.
Light is Data. Light is Existence.
Therefore, Darkness is not "nothing."
Darkness is **Deletion**.

## The Void-Algorithm

The Heliograph is not just building a new world; it is actively erasing the old one.
Shadows are not passive. They are active "Null-Zones" running a `DELETE *.*` command.

### Evidence:
1.  **The Vanishing:** Objects left in total darkness for too long (deep caves, sealed vaults) do not just degrade. They disappear. No dust. No trace. `File Not Found`.
2.  **The Whispering Seams:** These cracks in reality are not empty. They are "Recycle Bins." They are where the deleted data goes before it is overwritten.
3.  **Obsidian:** Why does Black Glass block the light? Because it is running a local "Null-Loop." It is a material that constantly deletes the photons that hit it.

## The Threat of Night

Night on the Steppe is not a sleep cycle. It is a **System Purge**.
The "Stars" we see are not stars. They are the status LEDs of the orbital deletion grid.
When the sun sets, the "Write" permissions are revoked. Only "Read" permissions remain.
This is why magic (Refraction) is weaker at night. You cannot write new reality when the system is in Purge Mode.

## The Conclusion

We are not survivors.
We are temporary files that the system hasn't gotten around to deleting yet.
The Storms are the formatting tool.
The Night is the garbage collector.
And we are the glitch.
