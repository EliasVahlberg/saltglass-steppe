# The Photonic Ecology

*Notes from the field journal of Dr. Amara Singh, Xenobiologist.*

## The Shift from Chemical to Optical

In the Old World, life was chemical. Plants turned sunlight into sugar. Animals ate plants.
In the Steppe, life is optical. The "Light" is not just energy; it is structured data. Biology has adapted to "read" this data to build mass.

## Flora: The Fiber-Optic Wilderness

### 1. The Data-Trees (Lumen-Oaks)
*   **Structure:** Trunks are translucent silica. Leaves are flat photovoltaic panels.
*   **Roots:** They don't just seek water; they seek "Signal." The roots form a vast, underground fiber-optic network connecting the forest.
*   **Behavior:** At night, they glow. They are "uploading" the day's growth data to the network.
*   **Danger:** Cutting a root releases a blinding flash of raw data (Laser burn).

### 2. Mirror-Moss
*   **Habitat:** Grows on the shady side of rocks.
*   **Mechanism:** It doesn't absorb light; it reflects it. It creates a "hall of mirrors" effect to trap photons in a loop, harvesting the decay energy.
*   **Use:** Excellent camouflage. Stepping on it is slippery (frictionless surface).

## Fauna: The Crystal Predators

### 1. The Prism-Wolf
*   **Diet:** It doesn't eat meat. It eats the *refraction* in your blood.
*   **Hunting:** It has a "Flash-Bang" howl. It emits a high-frequency pulse that overloads optical nerves, blinding prey.
*   **Anatomy:** Its fur is made of thousands of tiny optical fibers. It can change color to match the background (Active Camouflage).

### 2. The Lens-Crab
*   **Defense:** It carries a large, concave lens on its back.
*   **Attack:** It positions itself to focus sunlight into a death-ray to cook small insects.
*   **Weakness:** Cloudy days.

### 3. The Glare-Moth
*   **Attraction:** Drawn to high-intensity data sources (Terminals, Artifacts).
*   **Hazard:** A swarm of them creates so much visual noise/static that it jams electronics and causes seizures in humans.

## The Cycle of Light

1.  **Source:** The Heliograph beams data-light down.
2.  **Producers:** Plants "read" the data and crystallize it into glass-biomass.
3.  **Consumers:** Herbivores eat the glass to gain the stored charge.
4.  **Predators:** Carnivores eat the herbivores to concentrate the charge.
5.  **Decomposition:** When a creature dies, it doesn't rot. It "shatters" and sublimates back into ambient light.
