# The Whispering Seams

_Excerpt from "Anomalies of the Steppe" by Cartographer Jinx._

## Overview

The Whispering Seams are not a single location, but a phenomenon that occurs where the tectonic plates of the old world meet the new geometry of the storms. They are cracks in reality, fissures where the logic of the Steppe breaks down completely.

## Characteristics

### Auditory Hallucinations

The most defining feature of a Seam is the sound. It starts as a low hum, barely audible. As you get closer, it resolves into voices. Thousands of them. They are the echoes of the pre-Collapse world—conversations, broadcasts, music, screams—trapped in the geological strata and released by the shifting glass.

Travelers report hearing:

- News reports from the day of the White Noon.
- Personal messages from lost loved ones (often impossible, as the loved ones are still alive elsewhere).
- The "voice" of the Heliograph, reciting targeting coordinates.

### Gravity Distortions

In a Seam, "down" is a suggestion. Glass shards float in mid-air. Water flows uphill. It is possible to walk up a vertical cliff face as if it were flat ground, provided you don't look down and remember gravity exists.

### Chronological Leaks

Time moves differently in the Seams. You might spend an hour exploring a fissure and emerge to find three days have passed. Conversely, you might camp for a night and wake up only minutes after you went to sleep.

## Flora and Fauna

The Seams attract the strangest life forms:

- **Echo-Bats:** Blind creatures that navigate by mimicking the voices trapped in the Seam. They lure prey by sounding like a crying child or a wounded friend.
- **Time-Moss:** A lichen that grows in rapid cycles, aging and dying in seconds, only to be reborn. Touching it can rapidly age organic matter.
- **The Unbound:** Spirits? Glitches? Humanoid shapes made of static and dust that wander the Seams. They are harmless unless provoked, but walking through one causes intense vertigo and memory loss.

## Navigation

Navigating a Whispering Seam requires a "Sound-Anchor"—a device that generates a constant, rhythmic tone (usually a metronome or a simple drum beat). This gives the traveler a baseline reality to hold onto against the auditory chaos.

**WARNING:** Never speak back to the voices in the Seam. If the Seam learns your voice, it will keep it.
