# The Heliograph Network

*Technical analysis recovered from a crashed Archive survey drone.*

## System Overview

The Heliograph Network (Designation: SOL-ARRAY-9) consists of 12,000 orbital mirrors in geostationary orbit. Originally designed for climate control and agricultural illumination, the system operates autonomously following the "White Noon" event.

## Components

### 1. The Primary Mirrors (The "Suns")
Massive, kilometer-wide hexagonal mirrors. They can focus sunlight to an intensity capable of melting stone (or vitrifying sand) from orbit.
*   **Status:** 84% Operational.
*   **Behavior:** Erratic. Targeting logic appears to be looping on corrupted data sets.

### 2. The Relay Satellites (The "Angels")
Smaller, highly maneuverable satellites that redirect beams from the Primaries to specific surface coordinates.
*   **Status:** 60% Operational.
*   **Behavior:** Swarm-like. They often cluster over "high-interest" zones (ruins, large glass formations), creating localized weather anomalies.

### 3. The Ground Stations (The "Altars")
Surface control nodes meant to request specific lighting patterns. Most were destroyed or buried.
*   **Status:** <5% Operational.
*   **Behavior:** Dormant. However, active Saint-Keys can still handshake with these terminals, granting limited control over local light conditions.

## The "Editing" Process

The Network is not broken; it is hyper-functional. It interprets the chaotic landscape of the Steppe as "damage" and attempts to "repair" it using high-intensity heat and light.

1.  **Scan:** Sensors map the terrain.
2.  **Evaluate:** The AI compares the terrain to a pre-Collapse "Ideal State" (which no longer matches reality).
3.  **Edit:** The Network fires focused beams to melt, fuse, or cut the terrain to match the Ideal State.
4.  **Result:** Because the sand shifts and the glass refracts, the "Edit" always fails to match the model, triggering a new Scan/Edit cycle. This is the cause of the Glass Storms.

## Mythological Interpretations

*   **Mirror Monks:** Believe the Network is God's eye, and the Edits are attempts to communicate.
*   **Sand-Engineers:** View it as a broken thermostat that needs a hard reset.
*   **Glassborn:** Believe the Network is trying to build a home for them, a city of pure light.
