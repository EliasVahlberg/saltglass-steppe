# The Merchant of Memories

*A folktale told in the markets of the Steppe.*

There was once a trader named Oryn who dealt not in salt or glass, but in the things people wanted to forget.

He carried a set of **Mnemosyne Lenses**, rare artifacts from the deep Archives. If you looked through them and focused on a memory—a pain, a loss, a fear—the lens would pull it out of your mind and trap it in a small crystal bead.

A mother who lost her child to a storm came to him. "Take the grief," she said. Oryn took it. She left smiling, but she also forgot she ever had a child. She walked past her son's grave without pausing.

A warrior who fled a battle in cowardice came to him. "Take the shame," he said. Oryn took it. The warrior became brave, reckless. He died a week later charging a Shard Spider nest, having forgotten the fear that keeps men alive.

One day, a Mirror Monk came to Oryn. The Monk was old, his skin crusted with beautiful, terrible jewels of refraction.

"Take the light," the Monk whispered. "I have seen too much. The song of the Heliograph never stops. I want silence."

Oryn hesitated. To take a Monk's connection to the light was to take his soul. But the payment offered was a map to a pristine, pre-Collapse vault. Greed won.

Oryn raised the lens. He pulled the light from the Monk's mind. The bead that formed was blindingly bright, hot as a coal.

The Monk slumped, his eyes going dull and flat. He was silent. He was empty.

But the bead... the bead didn't stop growing. It fed on the ambient light of the market. It pulsed. It sang.

Oryn tried to put it in his pouch, but it burned through the leather. It burned through his table. It burned through the floor.

The bead became a seed. The seed became a storm.

They say the market at Oryn's Rest is still there, frozen in a perfect, eternal explosion of glass. And at the center, trapped in the amber of the storm, is Oryn, holding a lens, trying to sell a memory that was too heavy to carry.
