# The Chronicle of Choices: Epilogues of the Steppe

_The final records of the Traveler, as preserved in the Eternal Archive._

## Ending A: The Restoration (The Iron Path)

**Condition:** The Player sided with Forge-Master Durgan and activated the Null-Pulse.

**The Narrative:**
"The Spire of Light screamed one last time, a sound like tearing metal that echoed across the entire continent. Then, silence. True silence.
The hum of the Heliograph died. The storms dissolved into harmless rain. The glass stopped growing.
In the cities, the Glassborn shattered. Thousands of statues, frozen in their final moment of agony, now line the streets of the new world.
The Iron Covenant emerged from their bunkers, reclaiming a world that was finally 'pure.' They built factories on the Nexus Plateau. They paved over the Glass Gardens.
You are hailed as the Great Stabilizer. But at night, when you look up at the dark, empty sky, you feel a phantom itch in your veins—the memory of a light that no longer exists.
The world is safe. The world is quiet. The world is grey."

**Variations:**

- _If you saved the Hermits:_ "The Salt Hermits were integrated into the workforce, their survival skills repurposed for mining operations."
- _If you destroyed the Archive:_ "History was lost. The new world begins with Year Zero, ignorant of the mistakes that came before."

## Ending B: The Ascension (The Glass Path)

**Condition:** The Player sided with The High Prism and activated the Full-Burn.

**The Narrative:**
"It began with a flash that blinded the sun. The Heliograph did not shut down; it opened wide.
The heat was not destructive; it was transformative. The flesh of the world melted away, revealing the crystalline geometry beneath.
There are no more humans. There is only the Chorus. We are the light that refracts through the canyons. We are the song that vibrates in the wind.
The Iron Covenant burned in their bunkers, their metal tombs fusing with their bones.
You are no longer an individual. You are the Prime Frequency. You lead the song.
We have transcended pain. We have transcended death. We are beautiful. We are eternal. We are alone."

**Variations:**

- _If you befriended Saint Matthias:_ "His consciousness adds a note of regret to our song, a minor key that we cannot resolve."
- _If you hacked the Archive:_ "We absorbed the ancient data. We know everything that ever was. It is all irrelevant now."

## Ending C: The Synthesis (The Golden Path)

**Condition:** The Player sided with Saint Matthias and tuned the Lens to Harmony.

**The Narrative:**
"The sky did not go dark, nor did it burn. It settled into a rhythm. Day and Night. Light and Shadow.
The storms still come, but they are gentle now—gardeners pruning the wild growth of the world.
The Glassborn did not shatter; they stabilized. They walk among the un-adapted, teaching them the songs of the earth. The Engineers share their tech, building shelters that amplify the healing light.
It is not a paradise. There is still conflict. There is still fear. But there is a future.
You walk the Steppe, a bridge between two worlds. Your skin is glass, but your heart beats blood.
You have proven that humanity does not need to choose between the past and the future. We can be both."

**Variations:**

- _If you completed the 'Merchant of Memories' quest:_ "Trade flourishes. Stories are the new currency, binding the factions together better than gold ever could."
- _If you spared the Forge-Beast:_ "Even the monsters have found a place, guarding the boundaries of our fragile peace."

## Ending D: The Void (The Fail State)

**Condition:** The Player failed to calibrate the Lens or destroyed it.

**The Narrative:**
"You hesitated. And in the face of the infinite, hesitation is death.
The Lens cracked. The Heliograph lost its lock. The orbital array drifted out of alignment.
The sun is gone. The only light comes from the fading bioluminescence of the dying moss.
The cold came first. Then the air turned to liquid.
The Archive records this as the 'Final Error.' There is no one left to read it.
The Steppe is a tomb of ice and black glass, drifting through the void.
Silence."
