# The Echoes of Sector 7

_A transcript of a recovered audio log found in a sealed Archive sub-basement._

**[AUDIO START]**

**Voice 1 (Scavenger "Rook"):** "Light... look at the walls. They're not reflecting us."

**Voice 2 (Tech-Specialist "Jinx"):** "Don't look at them. Keep your eyes on the scanner. We're looking for the server core, not art."

**Rook:** "No, Jinx, seriously. Look. The reflection... it's moving independently. It's walking away."

**Jinx:** "Glitch in the glass. Stress fractures. Ignore it."

**Rook:** "It's not a glitch. It's... people. I see a crowd. They're wearing pre-Collapse clothes. Suits. Lab coats. They're running."

**[Sound of weapon safety clicking off]**

**Jinx:** "Rook, snap out of it. Your refraction index is spiking. You're hallucinating."

**Rook:** "I can hear them. They're screaming about the sky burning. They're... oh god, they're trying to get _in_."

**[Loud thudding sound, like fists on glass]**

**Jinx:** "Scanner is picking up... massive data traffic. But there's no cables. It's coming from the air. The ambient light is carrying packets."

**Rook:** "They aren't ghosts, Jinx. They're backups. The system backed them up when the bombs fell. They're stored in the walls."

**Jinx:** "That's impossible. The storage density required..."

**Rook:** "They see me. The one in the red coat. He sees me. He's... he's asking for a password."

**Jinx:** "Rook, don't answer. Do not interact with the interface."

**Rook:** "He says the password is 'Helios'. He says... he says he wants to go home."

**[High-pitched digital screech. Glass shattering.]**

**Jinx:** "Containment breach! Rook, get back! The light is leaking!"

**Rook:** "I see it now. It's not a city. It's a circuit board. And we're the virus."

**[AUDIO END]**

_Note: The bodies of Rook and Jinx were never found. Only their equipment remained, fused into the floor. The walls of Sector 7 are now completely opaque black glass._
