# The Glass Pilgrim's Journal

_Recovered from the remains of a traveler near the Crystalline Ridge. The pages are brittle, some fused together._

## Entry 14: The Crossing

We left the safety of the Hermit's enclave at dawn. The light was already harsh, reflecting off the salt flats with a glare that made my eyes water even behind the goggles. Kael says we're close to the Shimmering Spire, but Kael sees what he wants to see.

The Steppe is quiet today. Too quiet. The wind usually carries the sound of grinding glass, but today... silence. It makes the hair on my arms stand up.

## Entry 17: The First Storm

It came upon us faster than the charts predicted. One moment, the sky was a pale, washed-out blue. The next, it was a kaleidoscope of violet and angry orange. We scrambled for cover in a hollowed-out dune, pulling the heavy canvas tarp over us.

The sound... it's not like rain. It's like a thousand tiny bells chiming at once, escalating into a scream. I saw the sand outside the tarp _change_. It didn't just melt; it rearranged itself. A cactus became a crystalline sculpture. A rock split and unfolded into a geometric flower.

I checked my arm afterwards. A small patch of skin near the elbow has turned translucent. It doesn't hurt, but it feels... cold.

## Entry 22: The Encounter

We met a Mirror Monk today. He was standing in the middle of nowhere, staring at a beam of light trapped in a loop between two pillars of glass. He didn't look at us, but he spoke.

"The angle is acute," he said. "The reflection is almost perfect."

I asked him for water. He pointed to a patch of ground that looked dry as bone. "Dig," he said. "The light points the way."

We dug. We found a sealed canister of pre-Collapse water. How did he know?

## Entry 29: Kael's Change

Kael is... different. He took off his goggles yesterday. Said the light didn't burn anymore. His eyes are shifting, the irises fracturing like cracked glass. He spends hours staring at the sun.

"I can hear the Heliograph," he whispered last night. "It's lonely."

I'm scared. Not of the Steppe, but of him. He's becoming part of the landscape.

## Entry 33: Alone

Kael is gone. He walked into the storm this morning. He didn't run for cover. He opened his arms and welcomed it. I watched him dissolve into light and geometry.

I am alone now. My arm is fully glass up to the shoulder. I can feel the hum of the crystals in the ground. I think I understand why Kael left. The song is beautiful.

I will walk to the Spire. I will see what the light has to say to me.
