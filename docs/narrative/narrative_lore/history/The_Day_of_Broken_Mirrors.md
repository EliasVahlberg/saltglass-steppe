# The Day of Broken Mirrors

_Historical account of the event that shattered the Mirror Monk Order._

## The Event

Date: 47 years after White Noon
Location: The Grand Prism, former headquarters of the Mirror Monks.

The Day of Broken Mirrors marks the violent schism that split the Mirror Monks into their current factions. It was not a war of territory, but a war of interpretation.

## The Prophecy

High Abbot Malachi had spent decades staring into the "Eye of the Storm"—a massive, perfectly spherical piece of Storm Glass at the heart of the Grand Prism. He claimed it showed him the future of humanity: a transcendence into pure light.

However, a young acolyte named Elara discovered a flaw in the Eye. It wasn't a perfect sphere. It had a microscopic crack, a flaw that distorted every reflection. Malachi's visions were not divine truth; they were optical illusions created by a broken lens.

## The Confrontation

Elara brought her findings to the Council of Reflections. She argued that the Order's entire dogma was based on a mistake. The storms were not writing scripture; they were just chaotic energy refracting through flawed matter.

Malachi denounced her as a heretic. He claimed the crack was a test of faith, a "divine imperfection" meant to weed out the unbelievers.

The argument turned violent when Malachi tried to "purify" Elara using a focused light array. Elara, who had secretly been studying with Sand-Engineers, used a mirrored shield to deflect the beam back at the Eye.

## The Shattering

The beam hit the crack. The Eye of the Storm didn't just break; it exploded. The release of stored storm energy leveled the Grand Prism. The blast wave vitrified the surrounding three miles instantly.

Malachi and his loyalists were consumed by the light. Elara and her followers, shielded by their engineering tricks, survived.

## The Aftermath

The survivors split into three groups:

1.  **The Orthodox (Mirror Monks):** They believe Elara was a demon sent to test them. They continue to worship the storms and seek to rebuild the Eye.
2.  **The Broken (Glass Prophets):** They believe the explosion was the true revelation—that destruction is the only path to divinity. They seek to shatter the world like the Eye.
3.  **The Reflectors (Synthesis Seekers):** Elara's followers. They believe that light is a tool, not a god, and that understanding the physical properties of the world is the highest form of worship.

The ruins of the Grand Prism are now a forbidden zone, haunted by "Light-Echoes" of the monks who died there—burning silhouettes that reenact the final moments of the argument for eternity.
