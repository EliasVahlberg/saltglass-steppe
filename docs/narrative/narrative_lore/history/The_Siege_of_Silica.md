# The Siege of Silica

_From the war journals of Iron Covenant Commander Kaine Durgan._

## The Objective

Silica was a trade hub, a neutral ground where Monks and Engineers exchanged goods. But we knew the truth. The Monks were using it to smuggle "unstable" individuals—those with dangerous, high-level refractions—out of the Steppe and into the deep desert sanctuaries.

The Covenant could not allow this contamination to spread. We moved to quarantine the settlement.

## Day 1: The Perimeter

We established a Null-Field perimeter around the town at dawn. The effect was immediate. The glass architecture lost its shimmer. The ambient hum of the Steppe died down to a dull throb.

The Monks inside panicked. Their "scripture" failed them. Without the active refraction of the local glass, their light-based signaling was useless. We demanded surrender. They answered with a beam of focused sunlight from the central tower. It melted our forward barricade, but the Null-Generators held.

## Day 4: The Storm That Didn't Happen

The weather charts predicted a Class 4 Glass Storm. We dug in, expecting the usual chaos. But when the storm hit the Null-Field, it... broke.

It was the first time we'd seen it on this scale. The storm clouds hit the invisible dome of our dampeners and simply dissolved into rain—actual, liquid water rain. It was a miracle of engineering. Inside the town, they must have been terrified. They rely on the storms to reshape their defenses. We denied them their god.

## Day 12: The Breach

We breached the southern gate using sonic rams. The resistance was fierce but disorganized. The Monks fought with mirrors and lenses, trying to blind us, but our polarized visors rendered their tactics obsolete.

What we found in the sanctuary was... disturbing. They weren't just smuggling adapted people. They were _breeding_ them. Children with skin like quartz, eyes that could see into the UV spectrum.

## The Aftermath

We burned Silica. Not with fire—glass doesn't burn—but with sonic resonance that shattered every structure into dust. We took the children into custody for "purification."

The Monks call it a massacre. We call it sanitation. Humanity must remain human, or we are just another part of the landscape waiting to be eroded.
