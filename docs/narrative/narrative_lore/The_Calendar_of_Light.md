# The Calendar of Light: Time, Seasons, and Cycles

*Compiled by the Temporal Studies Division, Archive Historical Department*  
*"Time flows differently when reality itself is negotiable"*

## Introduction: Measuring Time in a Transformed World

The old calendar died with the Heliograph Event. When the sky fell and reality became negotiable, humanity needed new ways to measure time that accounted for quantum storms, reality distortions, and the cyclical nature of transformation itself. This calendar represents the consensus system adopted by all major factions for coordinating activities across the Saltglass Steppe.

**Temporal Classification System:**
- **Stable Time (ST)**: Normal temporal flow, reliable for planning
- **Flux Time (FT)**: Minor temporal distortions, requires flexibility
- **Storm Time (StT)**: Major temporal disruptions during quantum storms
- **Archive Time (AT)**: Precise temporal measurement maintained by Archive systems
- **Subjective Time (SuT)**: Individual experience of time flow (may vary significantly)
