## Items

### Storm Glass `◆`
**What:** Crystallized storm energy—fragments of vitrified air and light.  
**How:** Forms when glass storms reach peak intensity. The air itself fuses into solid shards.  
**Why it matters:** The universal currency of the Saltglass. Mirror Monks see it as sacred scripture made solid. Sand-Engineers value it for its unique refractive properties in optics. The Glassborn consider it kin—dead kin, but kin.

### Scripture Shard `?`
**What:** Fragment of pre-storm religious text, preserved in vitrified paper.  
**How:** When the Heliograph fell, its light fused entire libraries. Most burned. Some crystallized.  
**Why it matters:** The Mirror Monks seek these obsessively—each shard contains angles of prophecy. To others, they're curiosities. To the dying pilgrim, they're the last proof that the world once made sense.

### Brine Vial `!`
**What:** Concentrated salt solution with trace minerals from the deep aquifers.  
**How:** Salt hermits distill it from the few remaining water sources beneath the steppe.  
**Why it matters:** Heals wounds by forcing rapid crystallization of damaged tissue. Painful, effective. The salt seals what the storm opened.

### Saint-Key `⚷`
**What:** Pre-storm credential device, still recognized by Archive systems.  
**How:** The saints—machine-priests of the Heliograph era—carried these as proof of authority.  
**Why it matters:** The Archives still function. Their drones still guard. Without a key, you're an intruder. With one, you're a ghost of legitimate authority—and the machines cannot tell the difference.

### Angle-Split Lens `◎`
**What:** Optical device that reveals hidden geometries in the landscape.  
**How:** Crafted by Mirror Monks using storm glass ground to precise angles.  
**Why it matters:** The storms don't just change the map—they hide parts of it. Light bends wrong. The lens corrects for this, showing paths that exist but cannot be seen.

### Salt Poultice `+`
**What:** Crystallized salve made from rendered salt deposits and rendered fat.  
**How:** Salt hermits prepare these during the calm between storms.  
**Why it matters:** More potent than brine vials. The salt doesn't just seal—it replaces. Flesh becomes partly mineral. This is how the hermits survive: they're already half-salt.

### Veil Tincture `!`
**What:** Alchemical solution that temporarily dulls the glow of adaptations.  
**How:** Derived from dust wraith essence—the same property that lets them avoid the adapted.  
**Why it matters:** Adaptations mark you. Mirror Monks revere you; Archive drones flag you as deviant. Sometimes you need to pass unmarked. The veil lets you pretend you're still fully human.

### Glass Pick `/`
**What:** Tool with a vitrified head, harder than the walls it breaks.  
**How:** Forged in the Crucible—the same process that creates the Glassborn.  
**Why it matters:** The storms seal paths as often as they open them. The pick lets you make your own doors. But every swing risks shattering—the glass is strong, but brittle.

### Storm Compass `⊕`
**What:** Navigation device with a needle of pure storm glass.  
**How:** The needle resonates with approaching storm energy.  
**Why it matters:** Storms are not random. They follow the old Heliograph targeting patterns. The compass reads these patterns—not predicting the storm, but remembering where the light will fall.

### Saint's Tear `○`
**What:** Vitrified droplet from a machine-saint's optical system.  
**How:** When the saints died, their eyes wept glass. These tears crystallized.  
**Why it matters:** The tears carry residual blessing—or programming, depending on who you ask. They heal deeply and reduce refraction, pulling you back toward baseline humanity. The Mirror Monks consider using one a minor heresy.

## Enemies

### Mirage Hound `h`
**What:** Predator adapted to hunt in the heat-shimmer of the steppe.  
**How:** Evolved (or was engineered) to use refraction as camouflage. Hunts by thermal signature.  
**Why it matters:** The first enemy most scavengers encounter. Teaches the lesson: in the Saltglass, what you see is not what's there. They flicker at the edge of vision, then strike.

### Glass Beetle `b`
**What:** Armored insect with a carapace of fused glass.  
**How:** Feeds on storm glass, incorporating it into its shell.  
**Why it matters:** Durable, slow, predictable. The opposite of the hound. Teaches the second lesson: some threats you can see coming, but that doesn't make them less dangerous.

### Salt Mummy `m`
**What:** Desiccated corpse of a pilgrim, animated by residual storm energy.  
**How:** When pilgrims die on the salt flats, the minerals preserve them. Sometimes, the next storm wakes them.  
**Why it matters:** They were people once. They sought the same things you seek. Now they guard paths they no longer remember walking. The steppe is indifferent—it uses everything.

### Refraction Wraith `◊`
**What:** Storm-born specter made of bent light and crystallized air.  
**How:** Coalesces during glass storms from the energy discharge.  
**Why it matters:** The storm given hostile form. They phase through glass, reflect damage back at attackers. Fighting one is fighting the storm itself. They exist only while the storm's energy lingers—then they dissipate like heat shimmer.

### Shard Spider `s`
**What:** Small arachnid with legs of razor-sharp glass.  
**How:** Nests in glass seams, feeds on the blood of larger creatures.  
**Why it matters:** Individually weak. In swarms, lethal. Their bites inject glass fragments that increase refraction—each wound pushes you closer to adaptation. Some scavengers seek them out deliberately.

### Dust Wraith `w`
**What:** Malevolent sand formation, a localized storm given predatory instinct.  
**How:** Forms in areas of high ambient refraction, where the boundary between air and glass blurs.  
**Why it matters:** They fear the adapted—something about the glow repels them. This makes them useful indicators: if a dust wraith flees from you, you're changing faster than you realized.

### Archive Drone `Δ`
**What:** Pre-storm security automaton, still executing its patrol protocols.  
**How:** Solar-powered, self-repairing, programmed to protect Archive facilities.  
**Why it matters:** The drones don't understand that the world ended. They check credentials, enforce access, eliminate intruders. A saint-key makes you legitimate. Without one, you're a threat to be neutralized. They are the past refusing to acknowledge the present.

## NPCs

### Mirror Monk `M`
**What:** Member of a religious order that worships the storms as divine scripture.  
**How:** They embed glass shards in their skin deliberately, seeking visions in the refraction.  
**Why it matters:** They see your adaptations as holy marks. The more transformed you become, the more they revere you. But their reverence comes with expectations—they believe the adapted have a duty to interpret the storms.

**Faction Voice:** Cryptic, reverent, speaks of "angles" and "the light's will."

### Sand-Engineer `E`
**What:** Practical survivor who maintains the steppe's remaining infrastructure.  
**How:** Trained in pre-storm engineering, adapted to work with glass-fused technology.  
**Why it matters:** They don't care about your soul—they care about your usefulness. Adaptations are tools to them. They trade fairly, speak plainly, and judge you by what you can do, not what you're becoming.

**Faction Voice:** Terse, pragmatic, values function over form.

### Glassborn `G`
**What:** Human (once) who has fully embraced storm transformation.  
**How:** Survived multiple high-intensity storms, or underwent the Crucible rite.  
**Why it matters:** They represent what you might become. Not hostile, but alien. They remember being soft-skinned, but that memory feels like someone else's life. They respect the adapted; they pity the unmarked.

**Faction Voice:** Transformed perspective, speaks of "becoming" and "the shimmer."

### Salt Hermit `H`
**What:** Solitary survivor who has made peace with the steppe's harshness.  
**How:** Lives in the margins, harvesting salt, avoiding storms, helping those who find them.  
**Why it matters:** They offer rest—a rare commodity. They've seen countless scavengers pass through. Most don't return. They don't judge; they simply endure. Their advice is practical: "The storms will harden you or bury you."

**Faction Voice:** Weathered, laconic, speaks from experience.

### Dying Pilgrim `P`
**What:** Traveler at the end of their journey, carrying fragments of truth.  
**How:** Sought the Archive, or the Crucible, or some other answer. Found only the steppe.  
**Why it matters:** They know things—fragments of lore, hints about the Heliograph, names that matter. But they're fading. What they give you might be truth, might be delirium. The scripture shard they carry is real; their words are harder to verify.

**Faction Voice:** Fragmented, urgent, mixing memory and prophecy.

### Glassborn Merchant `G`
**What:** Trader who has crossed the line into full transformation but retained commerce instincts.  
**How:** Uses their crystalline body as display case—wares embedded in translucent flesh.  
**Why it matters:** They price by kinship. The more adapted you are, the better your rates. To the unmarked, they're gouging. To the transformed, they're family helping family. This is Pillar 1 in action: your body determines your economic reality.

**Faction Voice:** Businesslike but with alien undertones.

### Archive Custodian `A`
**What:** Half-machine keeper of pre-storm records.  
**How:** Merged with Archive systems during the fall, now neither fully human nor fully drone.  
**Why it matters:** They hold answers—maps, histories, the truth about the Heliograph. But they're bound by protocols. Without a saint-key, you're unauthorized. With one, you can query the past. They don't care about your adaptations except as data points: "BIOLOGICAL DEVIATION DETECTED."

**Faction Voice:** Procedural, cold, speaks in status reports.

## Thematic Connections

### Transformation Spectrum
Entities exist on a spectrum of transformation:
- **Unmarked:** Dying Pilgrim, Salt Hermit (human, unchanged)
- **Adapted:** Player, Mirror Monks (partially transformed)
- **Transformed:** Glassborn, Glassborn Merchant (fully changed)
- **Inhuman:** Archive Custodian, Archive Drone (no longer on the spectrum)

### The Storm's Children
Some entities exist because of the storms:
- **Created by storms:** Refraction Wraith, Storm Glass, Dust Wraith
- **Adapted to storms:** Mirage Hound, Glass Beetle, Shard Spider
- **Preserved by storms:** Salt Mummy, Scripture Shard
- **Worship storms:** Mirror Monks

### The Old World's Remnants
Some entities are echoes of before:
- **Still functioning:** Archive Drone, Archive Custodian, Saint-Key
- **Preserved but changed:** Scripture Shard, Saint's Tear
- **Forgotten purpose:** Storm Compass (reads Heliograph patterns)

## Design Notes

Every entity should reinforce at least one creative pillar:

1. **Mutation with Social Consequences:** NPCs react to adaptations (Glassborn Merchant pricing, Mirror Monk reverence, Archive Custodian flagging)

2. **Storms Rewrite Maps:** Storm-spawned enemies, storm-created items, storm-preserved corpses

3. **Readable Light Tactics:** Refraction Wraith reflects damage, Mirage Hound uses shimmer camouflage

4. **TUI as Aesthetic Strength:** Each entity has a distinct glyph with clear meaning

5. **Authored Weirdness:** Every strange element has rules (dust wraiths flee adapted players, saint-keys grant Archive access)

*This document defines the narrative foundation for all entities. Gameplay mechanics should reinforce these lore elements.*
