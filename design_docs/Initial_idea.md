# Initial Game Idea: Saltglass Steppe

**A Text-based User Interface (TUI) games (like Dwarf Fortress). I want it to be a RPG that takes heavy inspiration from Caves of Qud.**

## Saltglass Steppe

**Pitch:** A post-post-apocalyptic desert where ancient “glass storms” fused cities into shimmering labyrinths. You’re a scavenger-priest mapping the Saltglass and bargaining with machine-saints.

Core loop: Explore → scavenge relics → craft weird utilities → negotiate with factions → descend into glassed ruins.
Signature system: Refraction mutations — your body adapts to glass storms (prismatic skin, light-bending, laser “sunveins”), but each mutation changes how NPCs perceive you (holy/ominous/illegal).
TUI-friendly gimmick: Light/reflection is shown via ASCII “rays” and shimmering tiles; storms rewrite the map (swap rooms, rotate corridors).
Factions: Mirror Monks (see future in reflections), Sand-Engineers, Glassborn raiders, Archive drones.
Win condition idea: Assemble a “true map” of the steppe from contradictory, refracted cartography.

## Cross-cutting mechanics (very Qud-like, very TUI-friendly)

- Mutation/augmentation dual paths with faction reactions (holy/illegal/valuable).
- Rumor-driven exploration: towns generate leads as “legend snippets,” forming quest graphs.
- Procedural lore artifacts: relics with short histories and prior owners; factions recognize them.
- Social + stealth options: disguises, reputation tags, bribery, ritual speech acts.
- Tactical combat clarity: ASCII line-of-fire, cones, status stacks, limb damage.
- If you tell me what tone you want (more comedic Qud-weird, darker survival, or mythic), and whether you prefer overworld travel or mega-dungeon focus, I can refine one of these into a concrete starting region, factions, and a 10–20 hour “vertical slice” plan.
