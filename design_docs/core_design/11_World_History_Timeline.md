# 11 World History & Timeline

## Purpose

Connect the Saltglass Steppe's past to present-day gameplay. Every historical event should create a discoverable ruin, a faction belief, or a mechanical consequence the player encounters.

## The Three Ages

### Age of the Coast (Pre-Cataclysm)

**~300 years before present**

The Saltglass Steppe was the **Meridian Coast** — a dense urban belt of port cities, data centers, and orbital uplink stations. Key features:

- **The Heliograph Network**: Orbital mirrors that redirected sunlight for energy and communication. Controlled by the **Signal Wardens** (proto-Archive).
- **Salt aquifers** beneath the cities provided water; desalination was industrial-scale.
- **No glass storms** — the region was temperate, coastal, and heavily developed.

**Gameplay echoes:**
- Ruins contain pre-storm architecture: straight corridors, intact data wells, "soft" materials (concrete, steel) now fused with glass.
- Archive Drones still execute Signal Warden protocols — they don't know the world ended.
- "Saint-Keys" are old access credentials; finding one unlocks doors the Archive still respects.

### The Shattering (Cataclysm)

**~280 years before present**

The Heliograph malfunctioned — or was weaponized. Concentrated orbital light struck the coast in pulses, flash-vitrifying sand, buildings, and people. The sea boiled back. Silica storms began.

**What actually happened (hidden lore):**
- The Heliograph was sabotaged during a civil conflict. One faction tried to "reset" the network; another tried to destroy it.
- The system is damaged but not dead — it still pulses, creating storms.
- The "machine-saints" worshipped by Mirror Monks are corrupted Heliograph subsystems that occasionally broadcast.

**Gameplay echoes:**
- Storm intensity varies by region because Heliograph coverage was uneven.
- Certain ruins are "storm-locked" — the Heliograph still targets them, making them accessible only during/after storms.
- The endgame involves finding Heliograph control nodes and choosing what to do with them.

### Age of Glass (Present)

**Now**

Survivors adapted. Four major factions emerged from different survival strategies:

| Faction | Origin | Adaptation Strategy |
|---------|--------|---------------------|
| Mirror Monks | Survivors who found patterns in the storms | Prediction, ritual, acceptance |
| Sand-Engineers | Infrastructure workers who kept systems running | Technology, shelter, control |
| Glassborn | Those who embraced storm exposure | Mutation, strength, selection |
| Archive Drones | Autonomous systems that outlived their masters | Protocol, preservation, stasis |

**Gameplay echoes:**
- Faction territory reflects their origin: Monks near old observatories, Engineers near industrial blocks, Glassborn in the most storm-active zones.
- The player enters this world as an outsider — their origin is customizable but always "not from here."

## Key Historical Events (Discoverable Lore)

Each event is tied to a location, relic, or quest the player can encounter.

### 1. The First Reflection (~275 years ago)

A survivor named Kael-of-Angles claimed to see the future in a shard of fused glass. Founded the Mirror Monks. Died predicting his own death (or so the story goes).

**In-game:**
- The **Angle Cathedra** (dungeon) is built around Kael's original shard.
- Mirror Monks give quests to recover "scripture shards" — fragments of Kael's writings fused into glass.
- Relic: **Kael's First Shard** — grants a one-time "storm forecast" ability but marks you as a Monk ally (or thief).

### 2. The Brine Pact (~200 years ago)

Sand-Engineers discovered the old aquifers still held water. They traded access for labor and protection, becoming the Steppe's economic backbone.

**In-game:**
- **Brine wells** are Engineer-controlled; prices depend on your reputation.
- Quest: **The Dry Pact** — an Engineer outpost's well is failing. Help them dig deeper (find old infrastructure) or let a rival faction take over.
- Sabotaging a well is a major faction crime — but the Glassborn pay well for it.

### 3. The Glassborn Schism (~150 years ago)

A warlord named Vex Crucible united storm-mutants into a raiding confederation. After her death, the Glassborn splintered into rival warbands that still invoke her name.

**In-game:**
- Glassborn champions carry **Crucible-marked gear** — recognizable, valuable, and politically charged.
- Quest: **Crucible's Heir** — multiple Glassborn leaders claim descent from Vex. You can verify, forge, or destroy lineage proof.
- The player can eventually claim Crucible status themselves (high Refraction + specific achievements).

### 4. The Archive Silence (~50 years ago)

Archive Drones stopped receiving new instructions. They defaulted to "preserve and protect" protocols, becoming territorial and unpredictable.

**In-game:**
- Archive behavior is consistent but alien — they follow rules the player can learn.
- Quest: **The Last Broadcast** — find a functioning uplink and send a command. Options: shut them down, reprogram them, or restore their original mission (with unknown consequences).
- Hacking an Archive node requires **Saint-Keys** + a skill check; failure triggers alarm states across the region.

## How History Creates Gameplay

| Historical Element | Mechanical Expression |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| Heliograph malfunction | Storms have patterns; endgame involves control nodes |
| Faction origins | Territory control, reputation gates, quest-givers |
| The Shattering's survivors | Mutation is normalized; NPCs react to your adaptations |
| Archive protocol freeze | Hackable enemies with learnable rules |
| Brine Pact economics | Water as currency; well control as faction leverage |
| Glassborn schism | Rival champions, duel mechanics, lineage quests |

## Discovery Mechanics

Players learn history through:

1. **Relic descriptions** — items have "prior owners" and origin dates.
2. **Scripture shards** — collectible lore fragments that also function as crafting components.
3. **NPC dialogue** — factions tell biased versions of events.
4. **Environmental storytelling** — ruins show what happened (fused crowds, collapsed shelters, Archive patrol routes).
5. **The Cartography Ledger** — the player's map accumulates notes; contradictions between sources are flagged.

**Design rule:** No lore dump. History is always tied to something the player can *do* — a quest, a choice, a location to explore.
