---

Audience: Design team, production, engineering lead Owner: Lead Designer Purpose: Define the game as a system, not a story.

Contents:

- Core loop and progression loop
- Survival model (heat/hydration/refraction exposure) at a rules level
- Reputation system: tags, thresholds, pricing modifiers, hostility rules
- Loot economy: key resources (storm glass, brine, saint-keys), rarity bands
- Difficulty philosophy (how the game kills you, how it teaches)

Outputs: Designers have stable rules to build content against.
