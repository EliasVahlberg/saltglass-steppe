# 6 Progression: Mutations / Adaptations & Social Consequences

---

Audience: Systems design, narrative, UI Owner: Progression Designer Purpose: Make "Refraction Adaptations" feel like meaningful builds with tradeoffs.

Contents:

- Refraction meter rules + how exposure is gained/reduced
- Adaptation trees (Prismhide, Sunveins, Mirage Step, Saltblood) with exact effects
- Visibility/recognition rules (which traits are obvious; when NPCs notice)
- Faction reaction mapping per trait (table-driven)
- Suppression/mitigation mechanics (shelter items, treatments, vows)

Outputs: Build paths + balance targets + tables engineers can data-drive.
