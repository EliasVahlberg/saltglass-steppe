## Salt Flats (Central Hub Region)

### Geography
Open terrain of cracked salt pans and scattered glass formations. Long sightlines. Few natural shelters.

### History
The old coastal highway ran through here. When the sea boiled back, the salt remained. Now it's the main trade corridor.

### Faction Presence
- **Contested**: No faction dominates. All factions have outposts.
- **Last Salt** (starting settlement) is here — a neutral trade hub.

### Gameplay Character
- **Navigation**: Easy. Flat terrain, clear landmarks.
- **Combat**: Dangerous. Snipers and beam weapons are lethal at range.
- **Storms**: Hit hard. No cover means full exposure to edits and damage.
- **Resources**: Salt (trade good), scattered storm glass, caravan traffic.

### Key Locations

| Location | Type | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| Last Salt | Settlement | Starting hub. Neutral ground. All faction representatives. |
| The Salt Road | Trade route | Caravan path. Raid target. Quest hub for escort missions. |
| Dry Fork | Engineer outpost | Well + workshop. Frequent Glassborn raid target. |
| The Bleach Flats | Hazard zone | Intense glare. Navigation penalties. Hidden cache site. |

### Signature Encounters
- Mirage Hounds (use heat shimmer as camouflage)
- Caravan guards (friendly or hostile depending on cargo)
- Salt Mummies (emerge from cracks during storms)

---

## Glassed Reefs (Eastern Ruins)

### Geography
Dense labyrinth of vitrified towers, fused streets, and collapsed infrastructure. The old city center.

### History
This was the Meridian Coast's downtown. The Shattering hit hardest here — entire blocks fused into glass reefs. The richest salvage and the most dangerous terrain.

### Faction Presence
- **Glassborn territory**: Warbands claim sections by rite.
- Engineers mount salvage expeditions but don't hold ground.
- Monks avoid it (too "loud" for reflection readings).

### Gameplay Character
- **Navigation**: Hard. Maze-like. Storms rearrange corridors.
- **Combat**: Close quarters. Beam ricochets off glass walls.
- **Storms**: Dramatic. Rotations and swaps are common. Storm-locked vaults.
- **Resources**: Rich salvage, storm glass, pre-storm tech, Crucible relics.

### Key Locations

| Location | Type | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| The Shard Arcade | Dungeon | Tutorial dungeon. Fused shopping complex. |
| Crucible Block | Dungeon | Industrial zone. Dormant assembly arms. Craft components. |
| Vex's Grave | Landmark | Where Vex Crucible died. Pilgrimage site for Glassborn. |
| The Prism Market | Black market | Glassborn-run. Sells mutation accelerants, stolen relics. |

### Signature Encounters
- Glass Beetles (reflective shells, beam hazards)
- Glassborn champions (named enemies with unique gear)
- Refraction Wraiths (storm-spawned, die in darkness)

---

## Mirror Canyons (Western Highlands)

### Geography
Narrow canyons with walls of fused, mirror-smooth glass. Light bounces unpredictably. Sound echoes.

### History
Old observatory complexes were built in these hills. The Shattering polished the canyon walls into natural mirrors. The Mirror Monks settled here, finding the reflections "readable."

### Faction Presence
- **Monk territory**: Monasteries control canyon passes.
- Archive Drones patrol old observatory ruins.
- Glassborn avoid it (too exposed to Monk prediction).

### Gameplay Character
- **Navigation**: Tricky. Reflections create false paths. Monks sell accurate maps.
- **Combat**: Beam-focused. Mirrors multiply attacks — yours and enemies'.
- **Storms**: Light-rule changes are common. Glare tiles shift.
- **Resources**: Scripture shards, lens components, Monk services.

### Key Locations

| Location | Type | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| The Angle Cathedra | Dungeon | Monk holy site. Beam puzzles. Kael's First Shard. |
| Reflection Monastery | Settlement | Monk hub. Forecasts, readings, sanctuary. |
| The False Path | Hazard zone | Canyon where reflections create navigation traps. |
| Old Observatory | Archive site | Pre-storm data well. Drone patrols. Hackable. |

### Signature Encounters
- Monk pilgrims (friendly, offer cryptic hints)
- Archive Drones (scanning cones, alarm states)
- Echo Stalkers (predators that hunt by sound reflection)

---

## Singing Dunes (Southern Frontier)

### Geography
Rolling dunes of fine silica sand. Wind creates constant low tones. Footsteps trigger harmonic responses.

### History
The southern edge of the old coast. Less developed pre-Shattering, so fewer ruins — but the sand here has unique acoustic properties from the glass storms.

### Faction Presence
- **Transitional zone**: No faction dominates.
- Glassborn warbands pass through.
- Rumors of the **Brine Choir** (optional 5th faction) originating here.

### Gameplay Character
- **Navigation**: Moderate. Dunes shift, but sound can guide you.
- **Combat**: Stealth is inverted. Silence attracts some predators; noise repels others.
- **Storms**: Deposit fine glass dust. Respiratory hazards.
- **Resources**: Rare acoustic components, Brine Choir contacts, passage to the Brine Under.

### Key Locations

| Location | Type | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| The Hum | Landmark | A dune that produces a constant tone. Navigation beacon. |
| Whisper Oasis | Settlement | Small, secretive. Brine Choir presence. |
| The Throat | Dungeon entrance | Cave system leading to the Brine Under. |
| Dust Devil Flats | Hazard zone | Fine glass dust. Visibility and breathing penalties. |

### Signature Encounters
- Sand Sirens (lure with sound, ambush in silence)
- Dust Crawlers (burrowing predators, detect vibration)
- Brine Choir acolytes (if that faction is included)

---

## The Brine Under (Underground)

### Geography
Flooded salt aquifers, drowned metro tunnels, and pre-storm infrastructure. Dark, wet, and disease-prone.

### History
The old city's water supply and transit system. When the surface became hostile, some survivors went underground. The Engineers eventually claimed the aquifers.

### Faction Presence
- **Engineer-controlled**: They run the wells and pumps.
- Archive Drones guard old data centers.
- Glassborn raid for water but can't hold territory (they need storms).

### Gameplay Character
- **Navigation**: Linear but branching. Tunnels connect distant surface locations.
- **Combat**: Close quarters. No beam weapons (no light). Melee and traps.
- **Storms**: No direct effect, but surface storms can flood tunnels.
- **Resources**: Water (the most valuable resource), pre-storm tech, disease risk.

### Key Locations

| Location | Type | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| The Deep Well | Engineer hub | Main water source. Heavily defended. |
| Drowned Station | Dungeon | Flooded metro. Salvage and hazards. |
| The Cistern | Black market | Underground trade post. Smugglers, exiles. |
| Archive Vault 7 | Archive site | Sealed data center. High security. Major loot. |

### Signature Encounters
- Brine Sickness (environmental hazard, debuff over time)
- Tunnel Eels (ambush predators in flooded sections)
- Engineer guards (well-equipped, defensive)
- Archive security systems (turrets, locks, alarms)

## Signal Spires (Far North)

### Geography
Cluster of pre-storm communication towers, still partially functional. High altitude, exposed, heavily patrolled.

### History
The Heliograph's ground control was here. The Signal Wardens operated from these spires. When the system malfunctioned, the Wardens became the Archive — or were replaced by their drones.

### Faction Presence
- **Archive territory**: Highest drone concentration in the Steppe.
- All other factions want access but can't hold it.
- Endgame location — Heliograph control nodes are here.

### Gameplay Character
- **Navigation**: Vertical. Towers require climbing, elevators, or flight.
- **Combat**: Drone-heavy. Scanning cones, alarm cascades, hacking opportunities.
- **Storms**: The Heliograph targets this area. "Pulse" storms are common.
- **Resources**: Saint-Keys, Heliograph access, endgame quest objectives.

### Key Locations

| Location | Type | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| Spire Alpha | Dungeon | First accessible tower. Tutorial for Archive mechanics. |
| The Broadcast Hall | Endgame site | Heliograph control center. Final choice location. |
| Warden's Rest | Hidden location | Where the last human Signal Wardens died. Lore cache. |
| The Antenna Forest | Hazard zone | Dense drone patrols. High-value salvage. |

### Signature Encounters
- Archive Drones (all variants: scouts, guards, hunters)
- Heliograph pulses (environmental hazard, high damage)
- Ghost signals (pre-storm broadcasts, lore delivery)

## Regional Interconnection

### Travel Routes

| From | To | Route Type | Hazard |
|------|----|------------|--------|
| Salt Flats | Glassed Reefs | Open road | Glassborn patrols |
| Salt Flats | Mirror Canyons | Canyon pass | Monk toll or reputation check |
| Salt Flats | Singing Dunes | Dune crossing | Navigation, dust storms |
| Any surface | Brine Under | Tunnel entrance | Flooding, disease |
| Mirror Canyons | Signal Spires | Mountain path | Archive patrols, altitude |

### Storm Corridors

Storms follow predictable paths. Regions in the corridor get hit harder:

```
Typical storm path: East → Central → West
  Glassed Reefs (first hit, strongest)
  Salt Flats (moderate)
  Mirror Canyons (weakest, but light effects amplified)
```

Players can use storm corridors strategically:
- Chase a storm west to access storm-locked content in sequence.
- Shelter in the Brine Under to avoid surface storms entirely.
- Position in Mirror Canyons for "echo" effects (weaker storm, amplified light).
