First-Hand Accounts from the Saltglass Steppe
Mirror Monks — “Scripture in Angles”

1. Canticle Margin of Sister Vey (annotated into a lens-case, careful hand, devotional tone)
   I was told to stop naming the storms as if they are beasts. A beast can be tricked. A beast can be fed. The edits do not bargain.

Brother Halix says the Steppe is a text that writes back, and that our task is not to be safe but to be legible. I believed him with the clean certainty of the uncut.

Then the corridor behind the chapel rotated.

Not metaphor. Not dream. One moment the nave-door looked into the saltwind; the next it looked into a stairwell that descended into glass-dark, and the stairwell’s banister was warm as a living throat. The novices cried out because a door is supposed to be a promise, and promises are the only architecture most of us have left.

I did not cry. I watched the light.

There is a difference between glare and speech. Glare is flat violence; speech has edges. The edit that day was not chaotic—it was punctuated. The shards on the floor made a cyan \* that repeated at intervals like breath marks in chant. I held my palm over it and felt my skin tug, as if the Steppe wanted to pull me into alignment.

Halix asked, later, if I had seen the comma.

He meant the bend where the light hesitated, where the beam softened into something almost merciful before it hardened again. I told him yes, because he needed my yes. He is a master of yeses. He turns them into assignments.

Tonight, I will polish the choir lenses until my reflection disappears. Tomorrow, I will lead three unmarked pilgrims through the seam that used to be the west aisle. They will call me blessed.

If they knew how often I am afraid of the next sentence, they would call me something else.

2. Storm-Walk Confession of Novice Tel (breathless, angry, spoken into a recorder bead)
   If you are hearing this, it means I did not smash the bead like I promised myself I would.

They said the storm-walk was a choice. They always say choice. They say consent with mouths that have never been cut by the Steppe.

The chapel-labyrinth was bright enough to taste. The cyan \* in the floor made my teeth ache. I kept thinking: if light is scripture, why does it read like a threat?

I did what they taught—turn the head, soften the gaze, follow the shadow of your own body because it’s the only thing the glare can’t counterfeit. I did all of it, and the corridor still turned wrong beneath me. The edit didn’t care that I had memorized the hymns.

When it touched me, it wasn’t pain first. It was recognition. Like the Steppe had been waiting to see if my body would accept its signature.

And then—pain. The kind that doesn’t ask.

When I crawled back into the nave, Halix knelt like he was praying. He didn’t look at my face. He looked at my hands. My hands caught the candlelight and broke it into two weak flames.

“Assignment,” he whispered, reverent.

I wanted to spit. Instead I said thank you, because I am learning the monastery’s true liturgy: you thank the people who hurt you, and you call it meaning.

Sand-Engineers — “Function Over Faith”

1. Field Log of Forewoman Ressa Vane (clipped, utilitarian, numbers-first, faithless)
   Day 18 since last pump overhaul. Brine level dropped again. Salt creep in the intake. We need a new seal.

Storm forecast: likely within 9–11 turns (compass jitter consistent with Patterning). Anyone still calling that “the will of the Steppe” can volunteer to be willfully dehydrated.

Sent two crews into Crucible Block C for optics salvage. Crew A returned with three intact housings, one ◎ angle-split lens, and a fresh casualty: shard puncture, femoral. We patched it. We do not have enough Veil Tincture to hide that much blood from the drones.

Monks came at sundown and offered to “bless the intake.” That means they want to sit on our roof and watch the glare like it owes them money. I told them: if your blessing makes the pump run, I’ll carve you a shrine in the cistern. If not, get out of my worklight.

Important: the glass storm is not random. The edit rotated the north corridor three degrees last cycle. Three degrees is not poetry; it’s a mechanical tolerance.

We need a saint-key. We need Archive access. Not to worship the past—just to stop dying for lack of information.

If anyone finds ⚷, bring it to me. I will trade you water, tools, and a name that still matters when your body starts shining.

2. Letter from a junior cutter, folded into duct tape (plainspoken, gallows humor)
   Ma,

Don’t worry, I still have all my fingers. That’s a lie. I have most of them.

You asked what the Steppe is like. It’s like trying to rebuild a house while someone keeps moving the stairs when you’re not looking. And sometimes the someone is the sky.

Forewoman Vane says don’t look at it like it has feelings. She talks like the world is a broken pump you can fix if you swear at it long enough. I like her, mostly because she tells you the truth: if you’re useful, you eat. If you’re not, you become a cautionary story.

We went into a fused district yesterday. The walls were glassed over like candy. You could see old posters inside—faces smiling about a concert that will never happen. We cut through and found a room full of chairs melted into one another like they tried to hold hands when the light came down.

Kano says that’s scripture. I say it’s what happens when you point a mirror-sun at people.

We found a ◆ storm glass nugget in a vent. It hummed when I held it. I thought it was going to burn through my glove, but it didn’t. It just… remembered heat. That’s the only way I can say it.

Anyway. If you ever come this way, don’t. But if you do, come with me, not with the Monks. The Monks will turn you into meaning. I’ll turn you into someone who gets home.

Glassborn — “Kinship With the Shimmer”

1. Route-Song of Sable-of-the-Seam (lyrical, confident, metaphor-rich but practical)
   You can tell a first-timer by how they look at the glass.

The unmarked stare at it like it’s an enemy. The Monks stare at it like it’s a mouth. The Engineers stare at it like it’s a broken tool. None of them are wrong. None of them are enough.

I guide by reflection. Not by vanity—by necessity. The Steppe lies in straight lines. Reflections tell the truth because they show you what’s behind you without asking you to turn around.

We left the salt ridge at low sun, when mirages behave. I took them through a seam the last storm opened—cool air, brine-taste, quiet. The walls were mirrored so clean we could see ourselves as we might have been, if White Noon had missed us.

One of them—a scavenger with plain skin—kept flinching from their own face.

I told them: don’t fear the shimmer. Fear the hunger to stay unchanged. The Steppe doesn’t punish that hunger out of cruelty. It punishes it because it can’t afford inefficiency.

At the third turn, a drone Δ rose up like an old thought. It asked for credentials. I didn’t answer. Credentials are a language for people who still believe the past is law.

The scavenger almost ran. I touched their shoulder and let my skin catch the drone’s searchlight. I let it see deviation so it would focus on me—on my glow, on my angles—because I know how to stand like a question the past can’t solve.

When we passed, the scavenger whispered thanks.

I didn’t correct them. Gratitude is a kind of ritual too.

Later, when they asked me about the Crucible, I told them the truth: it hurts, and it costs you, and it gives you a name that doesn’t have to beg.

The Steppe is still being born. Some of us decided to be born with it.

2. Market Note from a Glassborn Merchant (wry, transactional, affectionate in a sideways way)
   Prices today:

◆ storm glass, common angle: fair trade.
◆ storm glass, singing angle (you know it when it makes your teeth ring): don’t insult me.
Veil Tincture !: expensive. Not because it’s rare—because everyone wants to be unmarked until they need to be seen.
A Monk tried to tell me the ◎ angle-split lens is sacred. I told him so is my spine, and I still have to sell it one day at a time.

A young one came in with new refraction in their eyes—fresh edit shine, scared, trying to hide it with a scarf. I gave them a discount, not out of charity but out of kinship. If we don’t recognize each other, the Steppe will recognize us alone.

They asked if being Glassborn means you never miss your old face.

I said: I miss it the way you miss a house you know the storm would have taken anyway.

Salt Hermits — “Endurance Without Interpretation”

1. Recipe-Sermon of Hermit Nala (homespun, practical, quietly wise)
   You can argue about meaning when you have surplus.

Here is what you do when the glare has cut your skin and you can see the glass dust glittering in the wound like stars:

Boil brine until it tastes like pennies. Add ash—not charcoal, ash—from a clean fire. If you can get crushed veilleaf, add it. If you can’t, add time.

Do not let a Monk pray over it unless you want them to start calling your infection a prophecy.

Do not let an Engineer “optimize” it unless you want them to measure your pain like it’s a resource.

You asked me what I think White Noon was.

I think it was a day when people died and the world didn’t apologize.

The Steppe doesn’t care what you believe. It cares what you can endure. Endure, and you’ll have time for beliefs later.

2. Campfire Story Told to Pilgrims, recorded poorly (dry humor, communal)
   Listen, I’ve hosted every kind of traveler.

The Monks come in polite lines and try not to look afraid. They always look afraid. They ask for water like it’s a sacrament and then stare at the sun until they’re crying and call it devotion.

The Engineers come in arguing about valves. They’re happiest when something is broken, because then it’s honest.

The Glassborn come in laughing. Not because it’s funny—because laughter keeps the drones from hearing your teeth chatter.

And the Archive folk—if you ever meet one that breathes—will talk to you like you’re a misfiled document.

One time a drone Δ came up right outside my brine pit and said: “CREDENTIAL CHECK.”

I said: “I’m credentialed by thirst.”

It didn’t laugh. Machines don’t. But it paused, like it had found a word it didn’t know what to do with.

That pause is why I’m still here.

The Archives — “The Past That Still Patrols”
