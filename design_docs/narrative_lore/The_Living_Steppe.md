## Introduction: Ecology in Transformation

The Saltglass Steppe is not a dead wasteland—it is a living ecosystem in constant flux. The quantum storms that reshape geography also drive rapid evolution, creating new species while transforming existing ones. This guide documents the flora, fauna, and environmental phenomena that define life in our transformed world.
