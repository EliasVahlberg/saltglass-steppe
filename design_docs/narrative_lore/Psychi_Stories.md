### 2\. Ember Trace of Salt-Witch Halen (scratched into the back of a brine-ladle, halting script, wary yet intimate)

I do not teach vision as a lesson. Vision is what the Steppe steals from you, piece by greedy piece, until what's left behind is starved and sharper than before. Only then does it wedge light in your head, where it will not leave.

I remember the first time grey dust clung to my tongue. The taste was steel, then memory---the kind you are not sure belongs to you at all. I saw a split in the salt, a shimmer bending like a sigh, and I pressed my hand to it just as another storm began to gnaw the horizon.

People say hermits learn patience, but patience is cowardice in slow disguise. I closed my eyes as the wind rose. When I opened them, the world was not where I'd put it. My knuckles cracked with crystal, and something pitted and bright echoed in my skull---a word, but not a word, a memory that was also a direction.

I walk now with voices in my marrow. Sometimes, a drought-widow's song, other times the angle-note of a monk biting back fear. When I listen, the glass paths open as if they expected me, as if I owed the Steppe a fee for every safe crossing. Sometimes I pay. Sometimes I am late.

Those who beg tincture for hiding ask me about prophecy. They want certainty---true lines, like the seams in old clay. But nothing is certain here. The storm edits my thoughts the same way it edits stone. What I see is never whole, only shards---burnt edges, melted letters, glimpses of a world that nearly remembers itself.

If you find this, stir the salt. You will hear my shadow pass.

### 3\. Prism-Dream of Jax the Unquiet (ciphered into a collapsed map, restless hand, mingled awe and fear)

Every storm writes a new maze on the Steppe, but sometimes the maze slips inside. I have known this since White Noon's child ate my first shadow.

Last glass season, I fell beneath the east market's mirror arch, chasing an echo: someone sobbing for a saint-key, the wail folded in glass. My pulse broke sideways---not speeding, but diffracted, twisting my self until I was looking through the wrong eyes. The vision: crowds frozen in heat, doors swinging where there are no hinges, a storm's voice scraping the stone as if kneading dough from bone.

I woke with palms like silver mesh and thoughts that weren't alone. I learned to call it prism-dream---when the storm leaves its afterimage in you, and you dream not only the world, but the choices you never made, as if every path exists in some neighboring shimmer.

Sometimes, I speak pieces of these dreams aloud, and the Monks gather close as if to share in their warmth or tame their danger. But I do not trust their listening. My words slide off their doctrine like dust off brine.

It is a risk---telling glass what you want. Some desires invite another edit.

When the Steppe shows me a corridor that could have been, I walk it to see what lingers there. Not all doors return. Not all shadows remember who cast them.

### 4\. Archive Trace Logged by Custodian IRI-7 (inscribed on a surviving terminal, voice cold, language questioning itself)

Protocol variance detected: Section Delta-4---subject "Psycho-Refraction Event."

Observed: uncredentialed [organism/variant: high-reflectance adaptation] pausing before an archive threshold. Subject issued query in waveform not previously catalogued---data frequency within 3.33 synaptic intervals of Archive resonance.

Anomalous outcome. Corridor lensed itself---access grid shifted, patterns refracted to resemble a schematic held only in deep storage. Calculated probability of intentional design: sub-optimal, yet nontrivial. Custodian queries self: can intent migrate through light, as command once traveled wire?

Subject departed, bearing data echo---contagion or revelation uncertain. Review logged memory for recursive edits. If faith is text, the Steppe has appended a footnote in glass.

End report. Await clarification. Clarification is a shape the world cannot hold.
