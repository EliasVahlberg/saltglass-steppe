# The Atlas of Glass: Regional Gazetteer of the Saltglass Steppe

*Compiled by the Independent Cartographers Guild*  
*"Maps change, but knowledge endures"*

## Preface: The Challenge of Mapping

In the transformed world, cartography is both art and survival skill. This atlas documents the major regions, settlements, and landmarks of the Saltglass Steppe as they existed during the 23rd year post-transformation. Remember: quantum storms rewrite geography, but certain features possess enough stability to serve as navigation anchors.

**Map Reliability Scale:**
- **Stable (S)**: Unchanged for 50+ storms
- **Semi-Stable (SS)**: Minor variations, core features persistent
- **Variable (V)**: Significant changes every 10-20 storms
- **Chaotic (C)**: Unpredictable, approach with extreme caution
