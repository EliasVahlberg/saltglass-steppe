# Ideas and Quirky Features

Here are some ideas and quirky features that could be implemented in the project:

1. **First-Person Inspect Mode**: Allow players to enter a first-person mode to closely inspect objects, read inscriptions, or examine details that are not visible from the standard third-person perspective. This could be limited to items and monuments of significance.

2. **Enemies that Mimic Player Actions**: Introduce enemies that can learn and mimic the player's actions. For example, if a player frequently uses a specific attack or ability, the enemy could adapt and use a similar tactic against the player.

3. **Late Game Enemies That Bypass The Save/Load System**: Create enemies that can manipulate the game's save/load system, making it impossible for players to rely on saving before difficult encounters. This could add an extra layer of challenge and tension.

4. **A ASCII Art Drawing Of The Player Character That Changes Based On Equipment**: Implement a system where the player's character is represented by ASCII art that changes based on the equipment they are wearing. Different armor, weapons, and accessories could alter the appearance of the ASCII representation. This could either be shown in the inventory screen or as a small overlay during gameplay.

5. **A ASCII Art Drawing of The Target Enemy** Similar to the player character, create ASCII art representations of enemies that change based on their type, status effects, or damage taken. This could provide visual feedback to the player about the enemy's condition.

6. **Permanent Status Effects That Alter Gameplay**: Introduce permanent status effects that can significantly alter gameplay. For instance the player could suffer from a traumatic brain injury that causes occasional screen distortion but could grant perks like Psychic savantism. These effects could be acquired through specific events or choices in the game and would require players to adapt their strategies.

7. **Companion Characters with Unique Quirks**: Design companion characters that have unique quirks or abilities that affect gameplay. For example, a companion might have a fear of certain environments, or they could provide buffs/debuffs based on their mood or relationship with the player.

8. **NPCs that follow the player around**: Implement NPCs that can follow the player around the game by their own free will, and the player can't make them stop following. This could lead to interesting interactions and challenges, especially if the NPC has specific needs or behaviors. This could pose an intressting dilemma for the player if the NPC is a liability in combat or stealth situations. But hurting or killing the NPC could have negative consequences on the player's reputation or story progression.

9. **Late Game Enemies That Are "Too Good" Strategically**: Design late-game enemies that are extremely challenging and require players to think strategically. These enemies could have advanced hueristics (min max, A\* pathfinding, etc) that make them able to from first glance determine if they can win against the player or not. If they determine they can't win they will try to flee or negotiate instead of fighting to the death.

10. **Dynamic Weather Effects That Influence Gameplay**: Introduce dynamic weather effects that not only change the visual atmosphere but also impact gameplay. For example, heavy rain could reduce visibility and affect ranged combat, while strong winds could alter projectile trajectories.
11. **The Player Background is "Discovered" Through Gameplay**: Instead of choosing a background at the start, the player's background is gradually revealed through gameplay choices, interactions, and discoveries. Once that background is revealed the player would gain access to the pros and cons for that background. E.g. the player could reveal that they are actually an aristocrat or that they grew up in a cult. This could lead to unique storylines and character development based on how the player plays the game.
12. **Exploitable Systems**: Create systems within the game that players can exploit in creative ways. For instance, a crafting system that allows for unintended combinations of items to create powerful or humorous effects.

13. **Different Builds and Playstyles That Are Unconventional**: For instance:

- A Psycic brawler build that focuses on getting stronger each time they get hit in the face or head (increasing their Psycic savantism).
- A sun cultist build that needs sunlight to function optimally so they have to place down mirrors to reflect sunlight into dark dungeons.
- A sapper build that can create acid to corrode enemy armor and structures but has to drink a lot of water and eat sulfur (or other elements).
- A stealth build is is almost invisible but because of that almost completely blind but has extremely heightened hearing and smell senses.
- A bard build that can't fight at all but can inspire allies and demoralize enemies with music and poetry. As they increase in notoriety more and more NPCs will join them just to hear their stories and songs.
- A gambler build that can manipulate luck in their favor but each time they do so they take a risk of suffering a major misfortune.
- A pacifist build that can't harm any living creature but can manipulate the environment and use non-lethal tactics to overcome challenges.
- A technomancer build that can hack into enemy systems and control machinery but is vulnerable to EMP attacks.
- A time-manipulator build that can slow down or speed up time for short bursts but suffers from temporal disorientation afterward. Due to the temporal disorientation they have trouble forming long-term memories and often forget important details about quests or NPCs. They could have something similar to the save game mechanic where they can "rewind" a few seconds of time but each time they do they risk creating a paradox that could have unforeseen consequences. There could be NPCs that are aware of the time-manipulator's abilities and may react differently based on their knowledge of potential paradoxes.
- A chemist build that can create and use various chemical concoctions for different effects but has to manage their inventory carefully to avoid mixing incompatible substances. They could be able to extract chemicals from the environment into glass vials that are apart of their body but if they blunt force trauma the vials could shatter causing negative status effects.
- A saltglass oracle build that can see and hear things from the past and also see through walls, illusions, and invisibility but is constantly bombarded by visions that can be distracting and disorienting. They could have to make a trade-off between clarity of vision and mental stability.
- A mirror monk build that can create and manipulate reflections to create illusions, teleport short distances, and even enter reflective surfaces but is vulnerable to direct sunlight and bright lights that can shatter their reflective abilities.
- A glassborn build that has a body made of living glass that can refract light to become invisible, create sharp shards for offense and defense, and even heal by reforming broken pieces but is fragile and can shatter from heavy impacts or extreme temperatures.
- A Sand-Engineer tinker build that can create vehicles, gadgets, and structures from salvaged materials found in the desert but has to manage resources carefully and deal with the limitations of makeshift technology.
- A Archive drone build that can interface with ancient technology, access vast amounts of knowledge, and even control other machines but is vulnerable to hacking and EMP attacks.
- A rumor-monger build that can spread rumors and manipulate NPCs through gossip but has to be careful not to spread false information that could backfire.
- A aristocrat build that can access large wealth but only have rude or hostile dialogue options with most NPCs. They would get in to conflicts with commoners and lower-class NPCs often but could use their wealth to bribe or intimidate others into submission.
- A commoner build that has very little wealth but has friendly or neutral dialogue options with most NPCs. They would have trouble dealing with aristocrats and higher-class NPCs often but could use their social skills to gather information and form alliances.

These ideas and quirky features could add depth and uniqueness to the gameplay experience, making it more engaging and memorable for players.
