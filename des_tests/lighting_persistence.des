# Test torch lighting persistence across turns
# Issue: Torch lighting only works for one turn then goes dark

setup:
  - new_game: seed=12345
  - move: right  # Pick up torch
  - equip: hand_torch

test_lighting_turn_1:
  - check: player_light_level > 150  # Should have torch + base light
  - wait: 1  # End turn

test_lighting_turn_2:
  - check: player_light_level > 150  # Should still have torch light
  - wait: 1  # End turn

test_lighting_turn_3:
  - check: player_light_level > 150  # Should still have torch light

# Expected: All lighting checks should pass
# Actual: Only first check passes, then light goes dark
